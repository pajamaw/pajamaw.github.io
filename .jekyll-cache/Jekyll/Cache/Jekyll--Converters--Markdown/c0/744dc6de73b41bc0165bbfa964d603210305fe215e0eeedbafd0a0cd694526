<p>I have many hobbies, and I tend to find new things that I want to become ‚Äúacceptable‚Äù at every other day. This constant intrigue into different new things can make it difficult to iterate upon an individual skill long enough to master it. A decade ago I realized that the only way to conquer this thirst was to start listing them and keeping physical track of them, as well as my day‚Ä¶and week‚Ä¶and month‚Ä¶and year.</p>
