<p>I have many hobbies, and I tend to find new things that I want to become â€œacceptableâ€ at every other day. This constant intrigue into different new things can make it difficult to iterate upon an individual skill long enough to master it. A decade ago I realized that the only way to conquer this thirst was to start listing them and keeping physical track of them, as well as my dayâ€¦and weekâ€¦and monthâ€¦and year.</p>
