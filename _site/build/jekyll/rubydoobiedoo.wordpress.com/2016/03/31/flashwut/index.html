<p>flash[:alert], flash[:notice], and flash[:error]</p>

<p>Which should you use?</p>

<p>These three hash keys may appear to be the same. And for all intents and purposes they are, the flash hash responds to any key value that you set to it which can they be modified by css or the js of your application.</p>

<p>That being said there is a common nomenclature that should be followed when using these, despite them all having the same default effect of displaying messages into your view.</p>

<p>A flash error is generally used to warn a user that something is wrong,  that they are prohibited from performing a function, or that something failed to be submitted, etc.</p>

<p>A flash notice is generally used to inform a user that something went as planned, e.g. that there comment was submitted, or their post was updated.</p>

<p>A flash alert I’ve personally seen as a middle ground between the two, so this you can use at your discretion.</p>
