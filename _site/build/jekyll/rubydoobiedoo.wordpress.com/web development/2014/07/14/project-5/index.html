                            This is the first (real) post in my Filling in the Blanks series. If you're like me, you most likely went through a programming bootcamp of some kind in hopes to achieve fame, fortune, a new hobby, and/or a job! If you are I wish you luck in all of your pursuits, and hope this finds you in time for that big interview.

Big O notation can definitely be a scary principle to those unfamiliar with the concept. So to begin here's a little road map of a few hot topics that I find frequently when the subject is spoken about.



	
  1. What is Big O (and which one are we talking about?)

	
  2. Why Big O?

	
  3. Examples of Big O in the Not-So Wild: Datastructures and Sorts


Before we go into though, I just want to add the disclaimer


## What is Big O?


Great question(s)!

Big O describes the efficiency of an algorithm. Specifically it's used to describe both the efficiency in time (Big O Time) and memory use (Big O Space) of an algorithm. Before we go further, remember that an algorithm doesn't necessarily just connect you to a huge complicated calculus theorem, every method/function that you create in programming is an algorithm.

Sorting through an array? You just used an algorithm!

Selecting an instance from a database? Algorithm!

Everything we do in programming is algorithmic, even if you didn't realize it.

Now there are actually three different types of Big O used in academia (Big O, Big Omega, and Big Theta) to describe runtime. Big O corresponds to the upper bound in a graph, Big Omega the lower bound, and Big Theta the tight bound.

Now don't get these concepts confused with best, worst, and expected case scenarios, because they don't actually correspond with any in particular each O notation can be used to describe each scenario. That being we will talk about the Big notation used in programming, Big O (which in academia is closer to Big Theta) i.e. the tight bound for a function.

So, back to a general programming definition, Big O describes the rate of increase (in memory i.e. space or time) as "n", your input, goes up. If your "n" is equal to an array, and you have to iterate through that array, you're going to do that in Big O(n) time, where n is the number of elements in the input array. If you have an array that you're grabbing an element from a specific index, that will take Big O(1) time, as it is done in 1 step no matter how large the array is.

Say we needed to run through an array twice,  does it take Big O(2n) time? No we'd still say that it takes Big O(n) time. When we describe Big O we don't use constants. A function that runs in Big O(n) we say will equal a function that runs in Big O(2n) because for different values of "n" those can be equal. So never use constants when you're describing a runtime!


## Why Big O?


So as you might be figuring it out now, we use Big O to find the time and memory that will be required to run a function. But what does that really mean and why should I care?

Well let's say that you just got a job with a dating company with 200 members (no worries I'm sure it'll get more successful!) and this job pays you to pick matches for OTHER people. It's got 100 guys and 100 girls. Those profiles are in one array and each user can match with either sex (cause we're being progressive in this post). Well let's say that the company doesn't allow you to skip users, and users don't get removed from the dating pool when they're matched with someone else.

Well, you want to get paid, so you begin. It gives you one person's picture and then you go through each of the 200 (including the same person's picture) as you get matches. Until you go through each match, then on to the next...ad nauseum. You take about 5 seconds per picture because you care (a little) but you don't get your check until you finish, so you finish....55.55 hours later! That's because the run time for the function is Big O(n^2). For each (n) or element of the array, you have to go through the each (n) or element of the array.

Well now you're thinking well this has to get better if the company was more efficient right? 55.55 hour work days are a lot too! So you find a company that has 200 users, but they're in two different arrays, a men and women's array. It gives you a random gender's picture and now you have to cycle through each female picking matches until you're at the end of the girls, and then to the next guy, and again a cycle through each female ...ad nauseum. Then once you finish the first gender you do the second gender. Well how long till you get paid? If it takes you 5 second per couple again, it will take you just under 27 hours to do it! That's a significantly better workday!.

Now we would say that this is Big O(2(m*w)) where m is the length of the men's array and w is the length of the women's array, and even though we're going through the same number of users, it takes less than half  of the time. Remember though, in a real setting we would describe this as Big O(m*w) as we should drop the constants.

But what about Big O space? Well let's use those 2 examples again. In both companies you'll have to use some sort of data structure to store your matches for a person. Let's say you use an array. That means that each person will need to have their own array for their matches. That means you're about to build out 200 array's of up to 200 people each...now that doesn't take any time to make as pushing to an array takes Big O(1) time. but it will take up (n^2) space. That also means that the second company, if they're using the same system will take m*w + m*w or Big O(m*w) time (as we drop the constant).

There are definitely better ways to store such information, and we haven't even gotten into utilizing them for matches! But already you can start to see how Big O would be used to describe real situations.


## Examples of Big O in the Not-So Wild: Datastructures and Sorts


But even then, Big O comes in the most handy when you use them to think about advanced data structures and sorting algorithms. We're going to be going over these in the next several posts in this series, but for now, we'll just begin by describing them and their various methods and runtimes.

First ![Region capture 2.png](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/region-capture-2.png)

Wow, you might be saying how do you even make sense of these charts?

One at a time! (And skipping the hard ones :) )


### Datastructures :


**Array: **As you may have assumed. The array is in fact a datastructure! Despite it being a simple one it does have one very unique capability that makes it invaluable, it's O(1) time for access. If you know the position of an element, you can immediately get access to it. Array's in many languages are often used as the baseline to create many advanced datastructures like Stacks, Queues, and Hash Tables.

**Stack: **A stack is an advanced datastructure that is peculiar in the fact that it can is essentially a LIFO, Last in First Out, array. Meaning that the latest addition to the stack, can be accessed first, while the others can only be accessed by going through each one before it. Think of stacks like the toddler game with the different size rings that can be placed on top of the wooden pole mounted on a wooden platform. Generally Stacks will use functions like push(item), pop(), peek() (to view the top element), and search(item). These methods take O(1), O(1), O(1), and O(n) time respectively. Stacks can be used to implement queues and are often used in DFS algorithms.

**Queue: **A queue is an advanced datastructure that is peculiar in the fact that it is a FIFO, First in First Out, array. Meaning that the least recent addition to the queue, is the first out of the Queue. Like a Stack, Queue can only be searched by going through each element. Think about a Queue like you would any line you've ever been in. Queues generally will use functions like unshift(), push(item), peek() (to view the bottom element), and search(item). These methods take O(1), O(1), O(1), and O(n) time respectively. Queues are often used in BFS algorithms.

**Singly-Linked List: **A Singly-Linked List (SLL) is an advanced datastructure that is peculiar in the fact that each node is connected only to the next node, with a home and an end node. Meaning that the least recent addition to the SLL, the Head, is normally the only one directly accessible much like a queue. SSL's can only be searched by going through each node's 'next' attribute that points to the following node. In a similar way to queue, adding and removing from/to the beginning of a SSL can be done in O(1) time, while adding/removing/searching to any other point would take O(n) time.

**Hash Table: **A Hash Table is an advanced datastructure that is peculiar in the fact that it's essentially an array with a plan. It inputs  key-value pairs in a way that allows you to access any element in O(1) time and add or delete any item in O(1) time. First, a Hash table is created as a certain size (as are arrays in languages like Java). And uses a particular function e.g. calculateHash(key) that uses the input items key and based off whatever constant algorithm you created in your calculateHash (a popular one is to turn the string into an integer and modulo it by the  size of the hash table) to create a hashed index that points to an index position in the array. In that index position is your key value pair stored. Hash tables are remarkably efficient (as long as you don't have too many collisions, something we'll explain more about later). Hash Table's are often considered the gold standard for datastructures to store and hold unsorted user information, and are sometimes used in conjunction with other advanced datastructures like Trees, to be extremely powerful.

**Trees: **A tree is considered an advanced datastructure, that are similar to SSL's in the way that they're made up of nodes that connect to other nodes. These nodes are called parents when they have nodes under them or their children nodes. Nodes that don't have children are called leaf nodes. The first node is called the root. There are several different sorts of Trees, from trees that only accept 2 children (Binary trees and Binary Search Trees), to some that only offer a single character of information (Tries). Tree's are used to connect points of information that relate to one another, and can be used with a variety of data structures. Sorted trees often have some of the best Big O search capabilities at O(n log(n)) as they can follow branches based off of simple conditionals.


### Sorting Algorithms:


**Quick Sort:  **The Quick Sort algorithm works by finding a pivot point, and then sorting the two resulting arrays around said pivot point. The act of finding this pivot point will generally sort the array into a higher side, and a lower side. Depending on the size of array, this pivot point will be found recursively on each minor array. The act of finding this pivot point is an algorithm in itself, and several different of these have made their way into modern use with the Hoare partition being the most efficient. With sorts you do have to worry about the average AND worst case scenario of time it will take, as it can be something to worry about because who knows how your data will be positioned? It's average time is O(n log(n)), but it can be as bad as O(n^2) in the right conditions.

**Merge Sort: **The merge sort works on the "Divide and Conquer" theory. It divides lists into sublists, then sorts those sublists, it then combines, and repeats the division as necessary. The final sublist becomes the ultimate sorted list. It  is a remarkably resourceful sort whose expected and worst case sorts are both O(n log(n)).

**Bubble Sort: **The bubble sort works by "bubbling up" higher values with lower values. It's a commonly used sorting tactic for trees and lists, where you can only access one value at a time. In order to do so, you must iterate through the array potentially n^2 times, making it a very time costly sort to do, with an average of O(n^2) time.

**Counting Sort: **The counting sort is personally my favorite sort. Why? I think it's absolutely brilliant. Unfortunately it does require three bits of knowledge for your array (I'm sure you could hack around it but for the common implementation these are required) that it only has positive values, that each value is an integer, and that you know the max. The graphic below shows it (decently), but it relies on you creating an array from the size of the max value. You then iterate through the first array, and every time you hit add 1 to the index of the range array to the index of that number. So if you have an array with 3 1's,  rangeArray[1] will equal 3! This addition to the rangeArray takes O(1) time due to Array's O(1) access time! You then (can) create a third final array which as you go through each index, you check the rangeArray and add each number the corresponding amount of times that it has in its "counter". I think it's a remarkably brilliant "hack" of the array's O(1) access time and can be done consistently at O(n+k) where n are the number of elements and k is it's range.

This may seem like a lot to grasp...and you're right! If you're new to programming, you're most likely new to Computer Science principles which all of these are based upon. But I promise, learning these more and more will help you counter any problem you find, and you'll be amazed at their utility in analytical problem solving in real life and for fun (check out [Nate Silver's company, 538, one of their users posts great riddles one of which I figured out using a Binary search method just the other day!)](http://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/the-riddler/)

This was just a brief (lol 2500 words) intro to these concepts, but I'll be going into each more in depth in the posts to come! Stay Tuned.

                            One thing that I never really learned a lot about during my time rapidly learning ruby and javascript at the Flatiron School, was data structures and algorithms.

My assumption is that this is most likely a pretty pervasive issue among most programming bootcamps, and for a good reason. Data Structures are not 100% necessary to understand programming, you can very well create websites and pretty complex programs that take in wide varieties of data, without even thinking about a Trie. And bootcamps want you to be able to create, and understand what you need to know. So besides some brain teaser/interview questions they probably won't be brought up much.

Data structures really play more of a role when one thinks about the efficiency of their program, the Big O of their methods and functions.

It wasn't until I dove headfirst into these concepts that I truly began to understand them and see why programming bootcamps and computer science really were different. Finding out why HashMaps were still quicker than the Map object in es6 because Map objects and Set objects still actually count insertion order! That most objects in fact are based off arrays, but that arrays weren't always constantly growing bracket monsters. Learning how .sort() actually works, and ways sort arrays and linked lists more quickly.

This will be the first of many posts that I write in this series, that seeks to lift the curtain from this monster, in the eyes of a bootcamp graduate that seeks to understand data-structures, algorithms, and Big O notation better. We'll start this series with a quick look at Big O notation which may not make sense at first, but as we're going through will make progressively more sense.

Brain teasers. Riddles. Lateral-thinking exercises.

They're all the same, and I'll spend the better half of the day trying to figure one out if you give me one. The act of taking a small amount of information and extrapolating any sort of connotation or denotation from it while thinking about it critically is my favorite thing to do.

That's why back-end technologies in programming have always interested me so much. The act of setting up means to record and access information, is the very act of setting up your own riddles.

How many users of a Tinder are male? How many people that signed up for Pokemon Go are still playing as opposed to one time users? What's the breadth of age that we see on Facebook?These are all questions that can be asked and resolved using the data that was collected from these tech monoliths. And I found that fascinating.

So in my own projects, the number one thing that I always focused on was the data models, the database, the joins, the relations..in a couple words - the backend. I found the front-end as almost frivolous, as a gimmick.

I found that revealing my projects to non-technical friends or family wasn't that enjoyable. They just couldn't understand the complexity that went into it - and so I grew bitter and arrogant. All of these puzzles that I had created and solved with less pieces meant so little to them and it disappointed me. It was their fault for not understanding how efficient I was being with my data models right?

...No, it wasn't. It was my fault. And I begun to put more and more effort into my UI. Then the total switch in my philosophy came when I read the infamous rant by Ryan Dahl. For those of you that aren't familiar with it, [here's a copy of it](https://gist.github.com/pajamaw/a8e0ff435e6be573738504785e1ffa5a). For a TL;DR though, he's the creator of Node.js, and he goes on to say how tired he is of it and all software that's needlessly complicated. And that ultimately that the User Experience is the only one that truly matters.

That got me thinking...lots of products are ousted by ones with inferior capabilities, but ultimately better usability and UI. *cough* A certain fruit company..*cough*. But actually, Apple is a wonderful example, Apple wasn't the first to use touch screens, they weren't the first to create the mp3 player, they weren't the first-to-market with any of their products truly...but that didn't matter, because everyone liked the UX was so superior. People didn't care about that Samsungs' products had better durability, or that LG's had the best camera. They cared about the overall _feel_ of the phone.

You can have the most amazing intricate product in the world, but if it's not fun and/or easy to use, no one will.

And so I've started creating new puzzles, this time putting myself in the head of a non-technical end-user. I've started to go back through all of my old projects.  I've begun bootstrapping, adding Angular, and/or just normal JS to the projects, trying to figure out the riddle of what keep's a person's attention.

Software is a tool to make things easier for people. And if non-technical people aren't wowed by your application...it's probably because it sucks. So don't fall into the pit that I did early on, the UI will always matter, because the end-user is more important than you and your ego.

                            I've always had a fascination with maps.

Definitely had my dad to thank for that, because of him my childhood revolved around maps like this:

![hobbiton.jpg](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/hobbiton.jpg)

Yup, I was the cool one that had read the Hobbit before you were required to in High School and had memorized what the inside of my locker looked like by the end of my freshman year (totally unrelated).

That being said, nearly everything that I build nowadays for fun, uses some sort of Maps API, for due to my love of cartography.

Recently I made a simple flights app that charts distances between two airports in the US. Basically it works like this:

![Flight gif](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/flight-gif.gif)

To do this I needed a couple things:



	
  1. A Maps API

	
  2. An Airports Database


So let's begin with number 1!

Easy enough, head over to [google maps developer page](https://developers.google.com/maps/), and sign yourself up for an api key. Immediately, you can use that to create your script at the bottom of your page. ![Region capture 1.png](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/region-capture-1.png)

Make sure you have the right placement! You're going to want to put it AFTER your div#map as you need to load the placement of the map, before you call the api for the map. Also make sure that you're using the geometry library, we're going to be using that later for our euclidian line.

Next we're going to setup our map initialization and center it on the US. ![Region capture 2.png](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/region-capture-21.png)

Great! So that's our first big step is done. Don't forget to add in your map#div!

At this point we should have a functional google map that you can pan around with.

Next let's grab our airports!

To do this I found the air-ports site, which is a API accessible database with the world's airports. Go ahead and sign up as a developer [there](https://www.air-port-codes.com/) so that you can setup grab an API key and secret.

Now that you've got that, we're going to use AJAX's handy autocomplete function in order to make an autocomplete search bar for the application. The request will look like this: ![Region capture 3](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/region-capture-31.png)

But remember we don't want ALL the airports we just want some of them! The US in particular! So our callback is going to use a filter function in order to sort out airports without a US country tag as well as airports that don't provide their position datapoints.

![Region capture 4.png](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/region-capture-41.png)

In order to make it functional let's add our search bar to the index.html front page. We're also going to add the necessary jquery libraries for the smooth opening and closing of the autocomplete entries.![Region capture 16.png](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/region-capture-16.png)

Great! now we have a usable search bar that queries the API for us airports! But when we select them we want to add a marker right? Back to the Google maps documentation! We'll use the google maps Marker object to do this. First we need to make sure that we have an event to capture the selected feature, so lets finish up our autocomplete function.

![Region capture 9](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/region-capture-91.png)

Great! Now lets make that marker function

![Region capture 7](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/region-capture-71.png)

Cool! So we're going to be passing 3 arguments to this function, the selected click which is an output of the select listener. And the dPoints and fPoints, which are empty arrays that we'll be using to store our markers.

So let's create call those variables underneath our DOMContentLoaded call (which should wrap around all of our code besides the initialize map function at this point). ![Region capture 10.png](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/region-capture-101.png)

and then finish up our setMarker function, by adding the dPoints and fPoints arrays (which correspond to our newly made empty arrays.![Region capture 14.png](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/region-capture-14.png)

Great! Now we've got a function that creates and persists our markers locally. If you noticed though that the dPoints and fPoints arrays contain slightly different marker information. We'll get to why that is in a second. Let's call our setMarker function now at the bottom!![Region capture 15.png](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/region-capture-15.png)

Great! Now we should have a map that uses autocomplete to specifically position markers on the map corresponding with the data query to the air-ports api that results in the proper latitude and longitude of the airports!

![giphy (1)](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/giphy-1.gif)

Technology is amazing.

But we can go deeper!

We want to add a flight path if we have two points on the map. So just for the sake of an understandable UI, let's add beginning and end search bars and a reset markers button so we don't have to refresh if we mess up.

So our body of the index.html should be looking something like this now![Region capture 18.png](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/region-capture-18.png)

Okay we'll so now let's add a new event listener and some easy functions to reset all of our variables and inputs. ![Region capture 19.png](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/region-capture-19.png)

Now that we have a "Get out of jail free" button, let's create our flight path. Now we're going to be using those f and dPoints arrays! So let's think about what we need here. We'll need to make sure that the function only works with 2 flight Points, then we'll need to use a couple other google maps functions such as the computeDistanceBetween function to find the distance and the Polyline function to draw the actual line!

![Region capture 20.png](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/region-capture-20.png)

So here we have our flight path being created if the fPoints array has two points. Further more we're usign the geodesic property to create a euclidian line, as planes generally don't burrow through the earth to get from one point to the other. Farther down, we've got a confirmation that reset's the map upon the function being called with a different number of fPoints.

But wait how is the distance going to be calculated??

Good question! The default for the computeDistanceBetween method is km, and we want it to be in nautical miles, so we're going to create a function that converts that really quickly then place the updated figure in our DOM.

![Region capture 21.png](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/region-capture-211.png)

Almost done! Where will we call our createFlight Method? Well first we need one more verification to make let it be called, so we don't have it being setoff with only 1 fPoint.

![Region capture 22.png](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/region-capture-22.png)Now that we have that why don't we call it in our setMarker function?

![Region capture 23.png](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/region-capture-23.png) And there you have it. Now you have a functional, javascript web app that calculates the distance between two airports. There are other things that you can do with this app of course, add a selection field to filter certain countries, add panToMarker functions (as I have in my example), make more functional search bars that save the start and end points in different arrays. And dozens of other implementations for you to try out and share with me (if you dare!). Now go forth and

                            I've always had a fascination with maps.

Definitely had my dad to thank for that, because of him my childhood revolved around maps like this:

![hobbiton.jpg](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/hobbiton.jpg)

Yup, I was the cool one that had read the Hobbit before you were required to in High School and had memorized what the inside of my locker looked like by the end of my freshman year (totally unrelated).

That being said, nearly everything that I build nowadays for fun, uses some sort of Maps API, for due to my love of cartography.

Recently I made a simple flights app that charts distances between two airports in the US. Basically it works like this:

![Flight gif](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/flight-gif.gif)

To do this I needed a couple things:



	
  1. A Maps API

	
  2. An Airports Database


So let's begin with number 1!

Easy enough, head over to [google maps developer page](https://developers.google.com/maps/), and sign yourself up for an api key. Immediately, you can use that to create your script at the bottom of your page. ![Region capture 1.png](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/region-capture-1.png)

Make sure you have the right placement! You're going to want to put it AFTER your div#map as you need to load the placement of the map, before you call the api for the map. Also make sure that you're using the geometry library, we're going to be using that later for our euclidian line.

Next we're going to setup our map initialization and center it on the US. ![Region capture 2.png](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/region-capture-21.png)

Great! So that's our first big step is done. Don't forget to add in your map#div!

At this point we should have a functional google map that you can pan around with.

Next let's grab our airports!

To do this I found the air-ports site, which is a API accessible database with the world's airports. Go ahead and sign up as a developer [there](https://www.air-port-codes.com/) so that you can setup grab an API key and secret.

Now that you've got that, we're going to use AJAX's handy autocomplete function in order to make an autocomplete search bar for the application. The request will look like this: ![Region capture 3](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/region-capture-31.png)

But remember we don't want ALL the airports we just want some of them! The US in particular! So our callback is going to use a filter function in order to sort out airports without a US country tag as well as airports that don't provide their position datapoints.

![Region capture 4.png](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/region-capture-41.png)

In order to make it functional let's add our search bar to the index.html front page. We're also going to add the necessary jquery libraries for the smooth opening and closing of the autocomplete entries.![Region capture 16.png](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/region-capture-16.png)

Great! now we have a usable search bar that queries the API for us airports! But when we select them we want to add a marker right? Back to the Google maps documentation! We'll use the google maps Marker object to do this. First we need to make sure that we have an event to capture the selected feature, so lets finish up our autocomplete function.

![Region capture 9](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/region-capture-91.png)

Great! Now lets make that marker function

![Region capture 7](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/region-capture-71.png)

Cool! So we're going to be passing 3 arguments to this function, the selected click which is an output of the select listener. And the dPoints and fPoints, which are empty arrays that we'll be using to store our markers.

So let's create call those variables underneath our DOMContentLoaded call (which should wrap around all of our code besides the initialize map function at this point). ![Region capture 10.png](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/region-capture-101.png)

and then finish up our setMarker function, by adding the dPoints and fPoints arrays (which correspond to our newly made empty arrays.![Region capture 14.png](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/region-capture-14.png)

Great! Now we've got a function that creates and persists our markers locally. If you noticed though that the dPoints and fPoints arrays contain slightly different marker information. We'll get to why that is in a second. Let's call our setMarker function now at the bottom!![Region capture 15.png](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/region-capture-15.png)

Great! Now we should have a map that uses autocomplete to specifically position markers on the map corresponding with the data query to the air-ports api that results in the proper latitude and longitude of the airports!

![giphy (1)](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/giphy-1.gif)

Technology is amazing.

But we can go deeper!

We want to add a flight path if we have two points on the map. So just for the sake of an understandable UI, let's add beginning and end search bars and a reset markers button so we don't have to refresh if we mess up.

So our body of the index.html should be looking something like this now![Region capture 18.png](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/region-capture-18.png)

Okay we'll so now let's add a new event listener and some easy functions to reset all of our variables and inputs. ![Region capture 19.png](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/region-capture-19.png)

Now that we have a "Get out of jail free" button, let's create our flight path. Now we're going to be using those f and dPoints arrays! So let's think about what we need here. We'll need to make sure that the function only works with 2 flight Points, then we'll need to use a couple other google maps functions such as the computeDistanceBetween function to find the distance and the Polyline function to draw the actual line!

![Region capture 20.png](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/region-capture-20.png)

So here we have our flight path being created if the fPoints array has two points. Further more we're usign the geodesic property to create a euclidian line, as planes generally don't burrow through the earth to get from one point to the other. Farther down, we've got a confirmation that reset's the map upon the function being called with a different number of fPoints.

But wait how is the distance going to be calculated??

Good question! The default for the computeDistanceBetween method is km, and we want it to be in nautical miles, so we're going to create a function that converts that really quickly then place the updated figure in our DOM.

![Region capture 21.png](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/region-capture-211.png)

Almost done! Where will we call our createFlight Method? Well first we need one more verification to make let it be called, so we don't have it being setoff with only 1 fPoint.

![Region capture 22.png](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/region-capture-22.png)Now that we have that why don't we call it in our setMarker function?

![Region capture 23.png](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/region-capture-23.png) And there you have it. Now you have a functional, javascript web app that calculates the distance between two airports. There are other things that you can do with this app of course, add a selection field to filter certain countries, add panToMarker functions (as I have in my example), make more functional search bars that save the start and end points in different arrays. And dozens of other implementations for you to try out and share with me (if you dare!). Now go forth and

Now last year when it originally came out, browser support for ES6 was quite limited, but you could transpile it into ES5 code...but who likes extra steps?

Now that it's been a full year, ES6 is fully supported by browsers and ES7 is currently on its way. You can read more about this transition over [here](http://v8project.blogspot.com/2016/04/es6-es7-and-beyond.html), since I'm done talking about the future.

Because who can rightly prepare for the future, without an adequate understanding of the past and present?

So to begin, what is  Javascript? Well, let's take a look at what the experts at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) said:

"**JavaScript** ([/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA_for_English)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript#cite_note-5)) is a[high-level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language), [dynamic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming_language), [untyped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language#Type_system), and[interpreted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreted_language) programming language.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFlanagan20111-6) It has been standardized in the [ECMAScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript)language specification.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFlanagan20112-7) Alongside[HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) and [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS), it is one of the three core technologies of [World Wide Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web) content production; the majority of [websites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website) employ it and it is supported by all modern [Web browsers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser) without [plug-ins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_extension).[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFlanagan20111-6)JavaScript is [prototype-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype-based_programming) with[first-class functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_function), making it a[multi-paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-paradigm) language, supporting[object-oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming),[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript#cite_note-ECMA-262-8) [imperative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming), and[functional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) programming styles.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFlanagan20111-6) It has an [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface) for working with text,[arrays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_data_type), dates and [regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression), but does not include any [I/O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, relying for these upon the host environment in which it is embedded.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFlanagan20112-7)"

![JfX8Rig.jpg](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/jfx8rig.jpg)

More or less, it's a scripting, dynamic, non-true OO language, that all major web browsers rely on in order to function. It's also become a popular server-side language, with the growing popularity of Node.js. One of the most interesting features of it grants it one of todays most notable function, the ability to asynchronously update a webpage, making realtime data adjustment (think of autocomplete, map updates, any sort of instant data aggregator like stocks) possible!

Wow PJ! That's incredible, but isn't it weird that it's the only language of the  [top 5 programming languages](http://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html) that isn't an OO language?

Glad you asked informed reader!

Well it's not a true OO language, it's a prototype-based OO language. Meaning that instead of using classical inheritance, where an object will be instantiated via a class and will inherit all the functions from said class, which can then be linked into a hierarchy by the class - Prototypal works by allowing objects to indirectly inherit from other objects, allowing you to indirectly create a form of inheritance from classes that do not need to be truly related.

Now E6 has brought about a lot of cool (if you're into OO) features that are brand new to vanilla JS  and that previous versions of JS allowed you to do, but via roundabout/hacky programming.

Now just a disclaimer, I'm no professor of JS, and I'm definitely not an expert. I'm simply a new, young, probably naive, programmer that is trying to understand this massive mound of information as well as I can - while helping others to do the same. [Some](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/the-two-pillars-of-javascript-ee6f3281e7f3#.xlv3np4nc) may say that it's a bad thing, that OO languages are not the way to go and that Javascript's malleability is one of its strongest attributes, that this bearing towards OO land is bad. As a new programmer though, I find OO languages very straightforward, they make sense, they mimic the world we live in, so I'm a fan.

Cool so let's begin, and what better feature to begin with than...

**CLASS INHERITANCE**

So in previous versions of JS, if you wanted to inherit from another object you had to first create your "class object" ![Region capture 3.png](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/region-capture-3.png)

and then extend it to another object. ![Region capture 4](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/region-capture-4.png)

but unfortunately here, if we were to check and see our square.constructor -> it would end up being classified as Polygon, which we don't want. We want it to be classifed as a Square! so now we have to go back in ![Region capture 5.png](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/region-capture-5.png)

FINALLY DONE.

Well let's take a look at our new class constructor in Es6, ![Region capture 7](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/region-capture-7.png)

and now try to extend it..![Region capture 8.png](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/region-capture-8.png)

and now we're done! wow, so it simplifies the entire process in an organized manner and then allows you to 'super' the previous arguments required to instantiate and still use the get area() method (a getter method btw!).

Incredible PJ!....but what else?

**STRING INTERPOLATION**

And no I didn't misspeak, no longer will we have to use string contecation as this isn't your father's string input method. Now we can write,

![Region capture 9.png](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/region-capture-9.png)

and guess what it'll print out if you call the sentence var?

"This finally works".

HOW GREAT IS THAT. No more playing with 1000 little +'s.

**PROMISES**

Promises are a whole blog post of their own, but until then know that vanilla javascript now supports them without the use of other libraries.

**ARROW FUNCTIONS**

Arrow functions are also very cool shortcuts for previously wordy code, and I still need to play around with them a lot more but until then check out this great example of how they now work. ![Region capture 10.png](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/region-capture-10.png)

Cool right?

Those are some of the new features that I find extremely interesting, and I definitely think we'll be seeing them come up more and more often as we move forward.

ES6 and Javascript in general is a fascinating language with a lot of depth. I encourage everyone to readup on not only the current implementations but also the past, as it gives you a better understanding of how things work they way they do and where it's headed.

In the meantime, I also recommend trying out [WarriorJS](https://github.com/olistic/warriorjs), to practice these skills!

"**JavaScript** ([/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA_for_English)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript#cite_note-5)) is a[high-level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language), [dynamic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming_language), [untyped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language#Type_system), and[interpreted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreted_language) programming language.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFlanagan20111-6) It has been standardized in the [ECMAScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript)language specification.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFlanagan20112-7) Alongside[HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) and [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS), it is one of the three core technologies of [World Wide Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web) content production; the majority of [websites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website) employ it and it is supported by all modern [Web browsers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser) without [plug-ins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_extension).[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFlanagan20111-6)JavaScript is [prototype-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype-based_programming) with[first-class functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_function), making it a[multi-paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-paradigm) language, supporting[object-oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming),[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript#cite_note-ECMA-262-8) [imperative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming), and[functional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) programming styles.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFlanagan20111-6) It has an [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface) for working with text,[arrays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_data_type), dates and [regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression), but does not include any [I/O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, relying for these upon the host environment in which it is embedded.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFlanagan20112-7)"

More or less, it's a scripting, dynamic, non-true OO language, that all major web browsers rely on in order to function. It's also become a popular server-side language, with the growing popularity of Node.js. One of the most interesting features of it grants it one of todays most notable function, the ability to asynchronously update a webpage, making realtime data adjustment (think of autocomplete, map updates, any sort of instant data aggregator like stocks) possible!

Wow PJ! That's incredible, but isn't it weird that it's the only language of the  [top 5 programming languages](http://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html) that isn't an OO language?

Glad you asked informed reader!

Well it's not a true OO language, it's a prototype-based OO language. Meaning that instead of using classical inheritance, where an object will be instantiated via a class and will inherit all the functions from said class, which can then be linked into a hierarchy by the class - Prototypal works by allowing objects to indirectly inherit from other objects, allowing you to indirectly create a form of inheritance from classes that do not need to be truly related.

Now E6 has brought about a lot of cool (if you're into OO) features that are brand new to vanilla JS  and that previous versions of JS allowed you to do, but via roundabout/hacky programming.

Now just a disclaimer, I'm no professor of JS, and I'm definitely not an expert. I'm simply a new, young, probably naive, programmer that is trying to understand this massive mound of information as well as I can - while helping others to do the same. [Some](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/the-two-pillars-of-javascript-ee6f3281e7f3#.xlv3np4nc) may say that it's a bad thing, that OO languages are not the way to go and that Javascript's malleability is one of its strongest attributes, that this bearing towards OO land is bad. As a new programmer though, I find OO languages very straightforward, they make sense, they mimic the world we live in, so I'm a fan.

Cool so let's begin, and what better feature to begin with than...

**CLASS INHERITANCE**

So in previous versions of JS, if you wanted to inherit from another object you had to first create your "class object" ![Region capture 3.png](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/region-capture-3.png)

and then extend it to another object. ![Region capture 4](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/region-capture-4.png)

but unfortunately here, if we were to check and see our square.constructor -> it would end up being classified as Polygon, which we don't want. We want it to be classifed as a Square! so now we have to go back in ![Region capture 5.png](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/region-capture-5.png)

FINALLY DONE.

Well let's take a look at our new class constructor in Es6, ![Region capture 7](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/region-capture-7.png)

and now try to extend it..![Region capture 8.png](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/region-capture-8.png)

and now we're done! wow, so it simplifies the entire process in an organized manner and then allows you to 'super' the previous arguments required to instantiate and still use the get area() method (a getter method btw!).

Incredible PJ!....but what else?

**STRING INTERPOLATION**

And no I didn't misspeak, no longer will we have to use string contecation as this isn't your father's string input method. Now we can write,

![Region capture 9.png](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/region-capture-9.png)

and guess what it'll print out if you call the sentence var?

"This finally works".

HOW GREAT IS THAT. No more playing with 1000 little +'s.

**PROMISES**

Promises are a whole blog post of their own, but until then know that vanilla javascript now supports them without the use of other libraries.

**ARROW FUNCTIONS**

Arrow functions are also very cool shortcuts for previously wordy code, and I still need to play around with them a lot more but until then check out this great example of how they now work. ![Region capture 10.png](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/region-capture-10.png)

Cool right?

Those are some of the new features that I find extremely interesting, and I definitely think we'll be seeing them come up more and more often as we move forward.

ES6 and Javascript in general is a fascinating language with a lot of depth. I encourage everyone to readup on not only the current implementations but also the past, as it gives you a better understanding of how things work they way they do and where it's headed.

In the meantime, I also recommend trying out [WarriorJS](https://github.com/olistic/warriorjs), to practice these skills!

                            Recently I wanted to deploy my [Manila app](http://manilalist.herokuapp.com) to heroku. But there was a problem. Heroku doesn't accept sqlite3 databases...and rails ships out automatically with sqlite3. So what's a man todo?

Heroku primarily uses the Postgresql database adapter. This means that I need to transition my sqlite3 database to postgres from within my application. So let's get started!

I only had some test data within my development database so I'm not going to worry about moving that data into the new postgres database. (There are ways to do this with the [taps](http://blog.ragnarson.com/2013/10/24/easy-database-migration-using-taps.html) gem, but for this we'll just KISS :D )

First in order to do this make sure you setup your heroku account and download the heroku CLI toolbelt.

Now that you've done that let's add a few gems in order to make this transition smooth.

We're going to add ![Region capture 1.png](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/region-capture-11.png)

to our gemfile in order to specify that we're using postgresql for our production database.

We're also going to remove sqlite3 from its normal spot in the gemfile and place it within the development test area. ![Region capture 2.png](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/region-capture-2.png)

In addition to that we'll add in the ![Region capture 3.png](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/region-capture-31.png)

to allow the rails functionality in the heroku environment.

Now make sure to run 'bundle install' in your terminal to add in these gems to your file!

There are a few more housekeeping items we need to do still though to ensure functionality.

Go to your config/environments/production.rb file and copy and paste this over the 'config.assets.js_compressor = :uglifier' code. ![Region capture 4](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/region-capture-41.png)

(haha well actually just copy it down since it's a picture file :P.jpeg)

Heroku doesn't support all js minifiers, so if you don't follow this step you may be able to successfully deploy your app to heroku, but you may get errors such as 'injector t invalid' --which stem from the minifier. So get rid of that and don't worry about the excess space you're taking up!

Now the big parts, lets reconfigure the database.yml file in your config folder. I commented out all but the default setting and put in the following: ![Region capture 5.png](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/region-capture-5.png)

Now there are different norms for adding database names, but I like following that each database should have the prefix of the name of the app and the suffix being the stage in deployment.

Great! save these changes with some good ol' git add, commits and pushes and lets begin the fun part!

Now first login to your heroku account by typing into the terminal 'heroku login' and add your information to log you in.

NOW LETS GET READY TO DESTROY EVERYTHING.

rake db:drop

rake db:migrate

rake db:create

Now that we've dropped our databases and install them onto our new postgres databases lets add these to our heroku app!

Type into terminal 'heroku run rake:db migrate'

You should see a bunch of sql fly through your terminal as everythings being created in front of you.

Next we'll push these changes to the newly created app.

'git push heroku master'.

And congratulations! go to your heroku homepage and check out your newly deployed application.

                            Google Maps is an absolutely amazing tool of the modern age, and all of its glorious utility, from its visualizations of traffic layers to its topographic map layers - is available to use FOR FREE through the use of its API.

If you'd like to see the angular documentation for using specific features then feel free to check out the angular documentation on it [here](https://angular-ui.github.io/angular-google-maps/#!/api/GoogleMapApi). Assuming of course your application won't be making over 100,000 api requests everyday for a course of 90 days (in this case this little setup may not help you!) here's a brief overview of the first few steps to create your project access key and setup the map on your app!

The rundown on how to do this goes like this.



	
  1. Go to [the google maps developer page](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/place-details) and sign in with the account that you'd like to use as a "Google Developer" (Don't go off thinking that you can use that title for your next resume spot though...)

	
  2. On the top left click the get a key icon ![Region capture 1.png](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/region-capture-1.png)

	
  3. You'll be asked to sign in again after a prompt telling you that you'll need to create a project. Once you get to the Google APIs page you'll register your new application. By going to the bottom and pressing "Continue".

	
  4. The next page you can name your specific browser key and after you press create you'll receive your API key!

	
  5. At this point you can add additional credentials if you'd like your app to send push notifications or would like your app to access the personal data via google omniauth.

	
  6. Next, ensure that you have downloaded the angular-google-maps angular js package. You can do that by accessing the full code from the [documentation](https://angular-ui.github.io/angular-google-maps/#!/api/GoogleMapApi) or by running "bower install angular-google-maps --save". Afterwards, install angular-simple-logger through the same method.

	
  7. With those dependencies added, require the location paths into the necessary view files (or sprockets for rails/sprockets-alternative for non-rails apps). A sprockets file will look something along the lines of this. ![Region capture 3.png](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/region-capture-3.png)Note: you may also have to add in Lodash, in some cases depending on the version of the API.

	
  8. Next you'll want to configure the directive after adding it to your angular module alongside nemLogging. The additional libraries can be added for particular google maps data attributes, which can be found in the [documentation](https://angular-ui.github.io/angular-google-maps/#!/api/GoogleMapApi). ![Region capture 4](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/region-capture-4.png)![Region capture 6](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/region-capture-6.png)

	
  9. Next lets setup your controller so that you can setup the directive within the view by configuring the map attributes. ![Region capture 8](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/region-capture-8.png)Other attributes are available, such as editable markers, but we'll just stick with the basics for now.

	
  10. Finally add in the directive to the view page and call the map attributes. ![Region capture 9](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/region-capture-9.png)And wala! You should have a working google maps in the view of your application.

                            Google Maps is an absolutely amazing tool of the modern age, and all of its glorious utility, from its visualizations of traffic layers to its topographic map layers - is available to use FOR FREE through the use of its API.

If you'd like to see the angular documentation for using specific features then feel free to check out the angular documentation on it [here](https://angular-ui.github.io/angular-google-maps/#!/api/GoogleMapApi). Assuming of course your application won't be making over 100,000 api requests everyday for a course of 90 days (in this case this little setup may not help you!) here's a brief overview of the first few steps to create your project access key and setup the map on your app!

The rundown on how to do this goes like this.



	
  1. Go to [the google maps developer page](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/place-details) and sign in with the account that you'd like to use as a "Google Developer" (Don't go off thinking that you can use that title for your next resume spot though...)

	
  2. On the top left click the get a key icon ![Region capture 1.png](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/region-capture-1.png)

	
  3. You'll be asked to sign in again after a prompt telling you that you'll need to create a project. Once you get to the Google APIs page you'll register your new application. By going to the bottom and pressing "Continue".

	
  4. The next page you can name your specific browser key and after you press create you'll receive your API key!

	
  5. At this point you can add additional credentials if you'd like your app to send push notifications or would like your app to access the personal data via google omniauth.

	
  6. Next, ensure that you have downloaded the angular-google-maps angular js package. You can do that by accessing the full code from the [documentation](https://angular-ui.github.io/angular-google-maps/#!/api/GoogleMapApi) or by running "bower install angular-google-maps --save". Afterwards, install angular-simple-logger through the same method.

	
  7. With those dependencies added, require the location paths into the necessary view files (or sprockets for rails/sprockets-alternative for non-rails apps). A sprockets file will look something along the lines of this. ![Region capture 3.png](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/region-capture-3.png)Note: you may also have to add in Lodash, in some cases depending on the version of the API.

	
  8. Next you'll want to configure the directive after adding it to your angular module alongside nemLogging. The additional libraries can be added for particular google maps data attributes, which can be found in the [documentation](https://angular-ui.github.io/angular-google-maps/#!/api/GoogleMapApi). ![Region capture 4](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/region-capture-4.png)![Region capture 6](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/region-capture-6.png)

	
  9. Next lets setup your controller so that you can setup the directive within the view by configuring the map attributes. ![Region capture 8](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/region-capture-8.png)Other attributes are available, such as editable markers, but we'll just stick with the basics for now.

                            </ul>
                            I estimated this project would take me about a week. Ultimately it took me twice as long with a hell of a headache, angular will punish you if you're unorganized, will punish you if you digress from your current code, and it will punish you for fun if it thinks that things have been going a bit too smoothly.. BUT hey thats programming in general for you.

The thing with angular though, and it may seem superficial, is that it looks really cool. I know it sounds dumb, but well written angular is fun to follow and has the added benefit of being javascript and allowing realtime updates of views, which i find fascinating.

The project I built out, which I'll walk with you step by step in hopes of making this easier for everyone, was a web application in the same vein as a to do list app.

You can check out the project by downloading the [repo](http://github.com/pajamaw/manila) at github and then running rake db:migrate to create the tables for the SQLITE db.


# First and most importantly what are the objectives of this project?





	
  1. Create an app that allows multiple users to create their own "bucket map" lists where they add a location/title/date/description of an event that they'd like to do in the future. E.g. I created a Summer list with things like go to the beach, with North shore tagged.

	
  2.  Allow users to delete, edit, and check off their events, as well as see others lists.

	
  3. There should be a map visible that changes its markers depending on the list selected.




# Great, now what tools are we using to build this?





	
  1. AngularJS for front end

	
  2. rails framework for backend

	
  3. [bower](http://bower.io/) for front end package management

	
  4. [active model serializers](https://github.com/rails-api/active_model_serializers) to create JSON objects from ruby objects and effectively create our api

	
  5. [sqlite](https://www.sqlite.org/) for db management

	
  6. [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) to make everything look good as well as for specific angular directives

	
  7. [devise and angular devise](https://github.com/cloudspace/angular_devise) for user creation and authentication

	
  8. [angular -ui router](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router) to create the single page app feel

	
  9. [angular - resource](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngResource/service/$resource) to handle our $http requests

	
  10. angular rails templates to hold our views for the single page app

	
  11. [angular google maps](https://github.com/angular-ui/angular-google-maps/issues/356)an to add interactive maps

	
  12. [google maps javascript api key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference#Marker) which can be grabbed by going to google to use their maps

	
  13. [angular -xeditable](https://vitalets.github.io/angular-xeditable/#text-customize) for edit in place features


Awesome, if you haven't heard of some of these no worries, I'd check them out but I was aware of half of them before i undertook this project.


# Now what's the roadmap?





	
  1. All the rails. Setup the rails app and the Rails Backend API routes, models, controllers, and the JSON API generated by ams, and the one view page with its layout.

	
  2. Setup template in app/assets/javascripts folder for angular app.

	
  3. Setup the planned ui-route configuration for the app in the app.js file.

	
  4. Setup skeleton for html templates that the routes will use and appear in.

	
  5. Make Controllers where the methods to create/save/update/delete the lists and list items will be stored.

	
  6. Make Services where $resource will be employed to fetch the json objects from the api generated from rails.

	
  7. Add gmaps functionality to templates and controllers.

	
  8. Use Angular Devise to streamline the user creation.

	
  9. Create User page where to access individual users info.

	
  10. Refactor!


As the title suggests this is going to be a multi post series, following along with the roadmap i've laid out In hopes of having more concise posts that go in depth on each feature. I'll be updating this series with a new post for the next week but in the meantime if you have any questions/criticism/advice let me know!

This project of mine entailed moving my [lv lesson review project ](https://rubydoobiedoo.wordpress.com/2016/03/17/review-web-app-in-rails-and-the-abyss/)'s front-end ruby framework into javascript.

So where as the server-side database management would still be in Ruby using the Rails framework, the backend instead of sending ruby objects will now send javascript objects through JSON. Creating an API thats rendered instantaneously in the view.

When I was trying to figure out how to exactly begin this project, I was pretty stumped. Surprisingly, I couldn't find a lot of resources online that would explain the simple question of "How do I begin transitioning a rails app to using JSON?"

Everything I found online was written with the agenda of pushing a particular JS framework, whether it be, React.js, Node.js, Angular.js, or a number of others.

So if you've found yourself in a similar situation CONGRATULATIONS. I'm going to try and guide you through my methodology and explain it in a better way than I found it.

So to begin I began with my [lv lesson review rails project](https://github.com/pajamaw/lv_lesson_review) which you can follow along with (it will either be using the master branch or a new ruby only branch if I've decided to merge my jsrails branch which is where I added the JS).

So first things first. What do we have to do?

Well I have 5 object models, users, categories, lessons, comments, and ratings.

Of these 5, we'll worry about the last 4 of them since our goal for this project will be the following:



	
  1. Make the Lesson directory more manageable.

	
  2. Translate the necessary objects into JSON

	
  3. Have the ratings show and update on the Lesson page without a refresh

	
  4. Have a lesson's comments show and instantly update on the Lesson page without a refresh

	
  5. Have the lesson title show

	
  6. Be able to create new ratings and comments from the lesson show page without a refresh

	
  7. Ensure that the ratings and comments are manageable on the lesson show page.


7 Goals. Not too bad!

So to begin lets deal with the pagination issue and make the Lesson directory a bit more manageable. Now the problem here is that there are 720 lessons. THAT'S A BIT MUCH.

So we should paginate these results to make them a bit more manageable. To do this I used the [kaminari gem](https://github.com/amatsuda/kaminari), this wonderfully powerful gem allows for easy (and most importantly pretty) pagination!

![Region capture 1](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/region-capture-1.png)

the kaminari gem coems preloaded with tons of methods such as the page_entries_info so it was simple to put in. The window: 2 argument sets the number of pages next to the current page that it will show.

In my LessonsController to finish the job I put in the![Region capture 2](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/region-capture-2.png)

the order followed by the page parameter which corresponds to the page_entires_info method in the view.

Unfortunately the pagination doesn't naturally keep track of all of the items listed, so if you'd like to list the number entry, without corresponding to the objects id (in this case I'd added more lessons so my lessons were off by a couple thousand :/) So I set a @first variable to the id of the first Lesson - 1, then I would subtract my @first from my current lesson.id to get the correct entry number throughout the different pages! (this would not work if your object's id's are not sequential or if they aren't in the correct order.



	
  1. <del>Make the Lesson directory more manageable.</del>

	
  2. Translate the necessary objects into JSON

	
  3. Have the ratings show and update on the Lesson page without a refresh

	
  4. Have a lesson's comments show and instantly update on the Lesson page without a refresh

	
  5. Have the lesson title show

	
  6. Be able to create new ratings and comments from the lesson show page without a refresh

	
  7. Ensure that the ratings and comments are manageable on the lesson show page.


Sweet! One down, now that are lessons index look pretty, what about turning the objects into JSON?

Well luckily for us, there's another [gem](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/AttributeMethods/Serialization/ClassMethods.html) that works surprisingly well! Active Model Serializer will turn our objects into JSON quick and easy.

After adding the gem to your gemfile, type in rails g serializer Class_name attribute_name

the gem will automaticaly generate your serializer files and folders through this command. leaving you to create the associations and other attributes. ![Region capture 3](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/region-capture-3.png)

here you can see the 4 objects that I've turned into serializers. If you're familiar with associations you'll immediately notice that I don't explicitly list a belongs_to relationship in my Comment and Ratings Serializers.

This is because the Universe is utterly uncaring and apathetic to people's suffering.

The AMS gem makes a lot of things easy, but belongs_to associations are not one of them. Currently the AMS gem does not have a belongs_to association method, and due to that there are a myriad of workarounds to allow you to access a comments user object. After searching for far too long. I found the most straightforward method of _simply adding the object as an attribute. _

You will undoubtedly run into 1000 solutions to this, but for my current situation, this worked flawlessly.

Besides that we need to make sure that our controllers our telling our view pages that they're about to get some json so my lessons, ratings, and comments controllers look like the following ![Region capture 5](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/region-capture-5.png)

[gallery ids="852,853" type="rectangular"]

teh respond_to method is called on by self and then you can call a language argument on them which will accept render parmeters. In each of these you can see that the window will accept html and render the plain ruby @ratings, while when the language is JS it will render the JS form of the object, allowing the view to process both languages!

Now for the hard part...

So my page is completely rendered in Ruby, And if this is where you are stuck, my advice is to go ONE by ONE. and not just delete everything you have and start new. You have your controller which renders both, so you don't need to!

So here in my lesson show page, I'm going to put all of my ratings for said lesson. So it will essentially render my index pages for ratings and comments obsolete. This is fine.

We begin by setting our div where our ratings will appear



so now that we have that...lets collect our json objects

![Region capture 9.png](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/region-capture-9.png)

Going one by one we submit our request to an id we set earlier to teh pathname

window.location.pathname (this grabs the pathname which in our case is lessons/:id)

next we set our response to lesson and begin setting variables to html that we'll insert into our ratingsAll div.

our lessonRatings array uses forEach to iterate through every Rating object and display its attributes in the html.

At the bottom we see where the ratingList which has collected all of the iterated Rating attributes, into the ratingsAll div.

Awesome! That Easy!

our comments array follows the same pattern and then it is all called on in our populateLesson function

![Region capture 10](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/region-capture-10.png)

this will be inputting the lesson title into the lesson_title div ![Region capture 15.png](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/region-capture-15.png)

In this function we also call on a parseTitle formatter function which is uses a regex function to remove time data from the title which is ingrained in the object(I've kept it there in case I want to use it in the future) if it exists.

The averageRating function at the bottom( which is also in my populateRatings and populateComments function) replaces my average_rating class method, so that now the average rating of the lesson will change with the addition of new ratings without a page refresh. ![Region capture 12.png](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/region-capture-12.png)

for the side by side here's how these two methods stack up against each other ![Region capture 13.png](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/region-capture-13.png)

now lets make sure that these automatically are generated when the page opens....![Region capture 14.png](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/region-capture-14.png)

and we good!

the document.ready call ensures that when the document is loaded the functions underneath are immediately run.

NICE! Knocked out three in one.

So now we have to make sure that the forms post to the correct paths. To do this I changed my form_for forms to form_tag. I did this because I wanted the forms to be used on the same page, so that I could mention them in divs. I'll just use my rating form as an example since my comment form follows a similar pattern

![Region capture 16.png](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/region-capture-16.png)

I added a custom path, which I then added to my route, to direct the form directly to a post request to my #create action which then redirects to the same lesson. In order to make sure that the page didn't refresh I binded the preventDefault(); function to the submit button. this button also bound the post request that submitted the JSON rating to my database. After the posting response I called teh populateRatings function to update my view allowing the new rating to be present without refreshing the page! (While also updating the average Rating!)

![giphy.gif](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/giphy.gif)ast one fast one!

This last goal I came up with as i was scrolling through all of the ratings and comments that were automatically generated and I thought "Wow, I hate this. I want these to disappear now". And BAM. NEW FUNCTIONALITY OUT OF ANNOYANCE.

So I added buttons! ![giphy.gif](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/giphy.gif)

They default so that the rating and comment forms are open while the Ratings and comments can be opened or closed. I added some button div's to my display and then added the following listeners as toggles, so that I could show/hide as opposed to just showing or hiding these results!![Region capture 18.png](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/region-capture-18.png)

So there you have it! In 7 easy steps you converted your pure rails application, into a ruby front end. There's quite a bit refactoring I can do, including removing a lot of ruby class methods, as well as transitioning my other views to use JSON, but as I was once told "Don't just make features, make features make sense". If you don't need up to date real time data. Don't bother with JS, if you do. worry about it and change it accordingly. Now My ratings and comments are synonymous with the lesson that they belong to, as they should be. And thats a good place to finish my projects first new feature.

If you have any advice, tips,  or that if you noticed  that I incorrectly addressed a component please do not hesitate to let me know in the comments!

NICE! Knocked out three in one.

So now we have to make sure that the forms post to the correct paths. To do this I changed my form_for forms to form_tag. I did this because I wanted the forms to be used on the same page, so that I could mention them in divs. I'll just use my rating form as an example since my comment form follows a similar pattern

![Region capture 16.png](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/region-capture-16.png)

I added a custom path, which I then added to my route, to direct the form directly to a post request to my #create action which then redirects to the same lesson. In order to make sure that the page didn't refresh I binded the preventDefault(); function to the submit button. this button also bound the post request that submitted the JSON rating to my database. After the posting response I called teh populateRatings function to update my view allowing the new rating to be present without refreshing the page! (While also updating the average Rating!)

This last goal I came up with as i was scrolling through all of the ratings and comments that were automatically generated and I thought "Wow, I hate this. I want these to disappear now". And BAM. NEW FUNCTIONALITY OUT OF ANNOYANCE.

So I added buttons! ![giphy.gif](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/giphy.gif)

They default so that the rating and comment forms are open while the Ratings and comments can be opened or closed. I added some button div's to my display and then added the following listeners as toggles, so that I could show/hide as opposed to just showing or hiding these results!![Region capture 18.png](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/region-capture-18.png)

So there you have it! In 7 easy steps you converted your pure rails application, into a ruby front end. There's quite a bit refactoring I can do, including removing a lot of ruby class methods, as well as transitioning my other views to use JSON, but as I was once told "Don't just make features, make features make sense". If you don't need up to date real time data. Don't bother with JS, if you do. worry about it and change it accordingly. Now My ratings and comments are synonymous with the lesson that they belong to, as they should be. And thats a good place to finish my projects first new feature.

If you have any advice, tips,  or that if you noticed  that I incorrectly addressed a component please do not hesitate to let me know in the comments!

Which should you use?







These three hash keys may appear to be the same. And for all intents and purposes they are, the flash hash responds to any key value that you set to it which can they be modified by css or the js of your application.







That being said there is a common nomenclature that should be followed when using these, despite them all having the same default effect of displaying messages into your view.







A flash error is generally used to warn a user that something is wrong,  that they are prohibited from performing a function, or that something failed to be submitted, etc.







A flash notice is generally used to inform a user that something went as planned, e.g. that there comment was submitted, or their post was updated.







A flash alert I've personally seen as a middle ground between the two, so this you can use at your discretion.

These three selector class methods are not interchangable. Yes, you can use these all to return the same values when they exist within your database, but what makes them special and DIFFERENT is what happens when those values DONT exist.







When you use find, the argument that it takes, it will by default try and find the id of the class being searched for, will return nil if the instance is not found.







Where as if you use find_by or find_by_id an exception error will occur if the particular instance is not found.







This is important because if you're buidling an application and you want to raise an exception error, you would use the find_by method, where as if you had setup your applcation to respond to a .nil? you would consider using the .find method.







My only recommendation would be to not get in the habit of using the .find_by_id method, as this is a shortcut that was made from the find_by method and will most likely not be passed on from Rails 4 to Rails 5 when they decide to cut down the fat.

self.

[/code]

a prefix that you'll commonly see in ruby. what does it mean though? whats the reason that some methods have self and others leave it out?

In ruby, methods that are defined by using 'def'

[code language="ruby"]
class Message
attr_accessor :announcement

def this_method
puts "this method is an instance method"
end
end
[/code]

will inherently be created as an instance method. meaning that if an instance of Message is created, e.g. @message = Message.new
@message.this_method

will return
"this method is an instance method"
These instance methods only refer to the instance of the class that they are called upon. class methods, are different. they won't respond to the same instance methods and the nomenclature of defining them is by putting self. in the method name


[code language="ruby"]

def self.new
@message = self.new
end

[/code]
.new is an example of a class method, that is an inherent method of classes. Knowing how .new works you can see that self. refers to the class Message. Another class method that is inherent that you're most likely familiar with is .create, which instantiates and then persists the instance of the class created.

Adding self. to the names of methods, and even inside of methods, won't ALWAYS break your instance methods, which makes it all the more dangerous. So make sure to get in the habit of using it correctly!

                            The beauty of rails is it _can be_ incredibly straightforward and simplistic, with all the functions that you require out of a powerful web application. Authentification? The [devise gem](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) is at your beck and call. Authorization? [Pundit](https://github.com/elabs/pundit) or [CanCanCan](https://github.com/CanCanCommunity/cancancan) will keep those policy scope methods nice and tidy. You want a pretty front-end? [Bootstra](http://getbootstrap.com)ps got you covered. Anything else that you might hate doing by hand? Rails can generate it. There are thousands of features that are all available at a click of the mouse....and that's what makes Rails difficult, not stating what you need, or asking then asking the questions on how to do something, but the unnerving search through the depth of answers for the solution that best fits the scenario. ![giphy](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/giphy.gif)Having run into this a lot during programming I've begun calling this depth of programming knowledge "ABYSS" or

Absolutely

Beyond

Your

Shit

Solutions.

I built out a review site with a simple bootstrap front-end where you can rate and comment on the Flatiron School's  Learn-Verified Full Stack Web Development Course and then allows users to rate the lessons in difficulty as well as add comments to each lesson that can then be viewed by visitors and users.

If you'd like to follow along with my project the repo can be found [here](https://github.com/pajamaw/lv_lesson_review).

The walkthrough:

The greatest obstacle I run into with rails is getting lost in the ABYSS (the same issue I brought up earlier)

.![giphy (1)](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/giphy-1.gif)

There are SO MANY GODDAMN ways to answer a question. I've lost friends and family to the ABYSS after they stumbled into stackoverflow forums looking for  the correct form_tag to use. Because of the ABYSS, the first step in any project, is to create a workflow. I can't get over how extremely important this is if you'd like to maintain your sanity and prevent getting lost in the ABYSS along the way.

There are several ways to setup a workflow. The best way, imho, is through TDD or BDD depending on what you're used to. I'm talking about using testing suites like  cucumber, selenium, capybara, rspec, or the dozens of others that force you to sit down and write down what you want, then write down what you require to get there, so that you can then create it this allows you to navigate the abyss if you need an answer, solve the problem and then most importantly, _ move on_.

Despite my belief in testing, I chose what I believe is the second best method (which resulted in the project taking longer than I expected),  s0 I wrote a list in the following fashion.

WHAT AM I BUILDING HERE:

you're building a review application for the Learn Verified courses, pj.

WHAT DO I NEED

Statement: The lessons, there are literally hundreds of them that I'm not manually putting in by hand

Question: Well how do i scrape it then?

Answer: build out a Scraper, then scrape that DATA.

I used the mechanize gem on the which uses  Nokogiri and URI to open and parse web pages, with some added features, such as the ability to fill out forms, click buttons and more! After i found my desired page with its css tags I made the following

[code language="ruby"]
def agent
agent = Mechanize.new
end

def get_page
page = agent.get('http://www.learn.co/pajamaw.html')
end

def lesson_titles
page.search(&amp;amp;amp;quot;.lesson td span&amp;amp;amp;quot;).collect{|title| title.text}
end
[/code]

which allowed for me to grab all of the lesson titles here.

S. There needs to be organization among those lists,

Q. How do I organize it?

A. build it out so that you scrape the categories as well. I used Mechanize for the webpage parsing and the IRB to find the right selections then created the following.

To do this I had to change my outlook from getting a bunch of individual lessons, to I need to get a each category, with all of its lessons.

[code language="ruby"]

def get_info_blocks
info = get_page.search('div[data-topic-slug]')
end

def get_category_and_lesson_titles
get_info_blocks.each do |lesson_block|
if lesson_block.css('div div h3').text != &amp;amp;amp;quot;&amp;amp;amp;quot;
@category = Category.new(title: lesson_block.css('div div h3').text)
lesson_block.css('tr.lesson').each do |lesson|
@lesson = Lesson.new(title: lesson.text)
@lesson.category_id = @category.id
@category.lessons &amp;amp;amp;lt;&amp;amp;amp;lt; @lesson
@category.save
@lesson.save
end
end
end

[/code]

Nice I've got the data! We'll hold on to that for later now.

S. I need users.

Q. How do I make users?

A. [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise), Baby!

After you throw in the devise gem into your gemfile and bundle install, devise will set EVERYTHING UP FOR YOU. i shit you not. type in 'rails g devise:install' and then follow the prompt for the whatever else you want to setup through it. it's magic.

S. I need users to have comments and ratings and I need categories which will have lessons, which I want nested to also have those same comments and ratings.

Q. How do I create all these models and their controllers ?

A. You just do.

Literally though. for this just start putting down some 'rails g' actions. Whichever ones you prefer to generate the necessary components. I personally go for the 'rails g resource' generators because it creates your migration files, your models, and your users, without adding any unnecessary crud actions and routes that you might not use, as well as setting up a blanket resources: "class" route. then setup your associations. as opposed to my [Sinatra Project](https://rubydoobiedoo.wordpress.com/2016/03/02/pedigree-sinatra-ar-mvc-app/) where I was using self-joins and lots of other fun stuff, this time we had our basic belongs_to and has_many relationships.  User has_many comments and ratings. Categories has many Lessons and has many ratings and comments through lessons. Ratings and comments both belongs_to a lesson and a user. I setup all of my foreign_key relationships (all of the models with belongs to gets a foreign key!) I migrated.

S. This is essentially a site for LV students right? I need authentification to ensure that people from LV can come in to become users, while others cannot, I also need to make sure that the users dont screw with other  users things.

Q. How can i ensure that LV are the only ones, and also make sure every user keeps his hands to himself?

A. well can't make them login with their LV credentials (actually i could if i used the student scraper from my [karma project](https://rubydoobiedoo.wordpress.com/2016/02/13/my-first-gem/) and then students would authenticate with omniauth but every github authentification had a final check to make sure they were also a stud...AHHH NICE TRY, ABYSS) but i can make sure they at least have a github account so github-omniauth for verification. While I can use pundit for to make sure that user's don't play with others things.

Omniauth is literally just magic. I've used the Facebook Omniauth and the Github omniauth and I found the github one much less buggy, may have just been lucky chance though. **[https://www.codementor.io/ruby-on-rails/tutorial/rails-omniauth-with-devise--github-example](https://www.codementor.io/ruby-on-rails/tutorial/rails-omniauth-with-devise--github-example) **I followed this guide to a T. As for ensuring everyone keeps their hands off of each other's belongings I setup 

[code language="ruby"]

 private
#app/controllers/application_controller.rb

 def user_not_authorized
 flash[:alert] = "You are not authorized to perform this action."
 redirect_to root_path
 end

 def require_login
 unless logged_in?
 flash[:alert] = "You must be logged in to access this section"
 redirect_to new_user_session_path 
 end
 end

 def logged_in?
 !!current_user
 end

end

[/code]



I use the #user_not_authorized to create a custom error which rescues a user from breaking the program and submits an error to the window and redirects them when they access something they don't have permissions to. These policies are included by including Pundit. Pundit authorizations are stored in my policies folder, which compartmentalizes all of my authorization models and methods for users. This prevent users from touching objects that don't include their own user.id., unless they have special privileges due to their role that I accounted for in my other policy files (we'll get to those soon). The #require_login method, I then use through before_filter :require_login in my different controller methods where I first want to ensure that all visitors of the site are users, offering a distinct error from when users are not authorized to view or commit certain actions.



S. KK I've got that data about the categories and the lessons but i need to port it into the database now.

Q. How do I port it into the database? Should I hop aboard the one-by-one form_train?

A. NOPE GET OFF THE FORM TRAIN. Build that DATA into a class, with methods that instantiate each Lesson and their categories, and then a method that runs all of the processes. Call that class in your db/seeds.db file. then rake commands baby!

I've never built out a seed data like this before and it was surprisingly difficult to find a forum online that explained it out. So I just assumed it would work out if i called a new scraper instantiation and called run on it...which it did! I took those methods that we looked at earlier and bundled them in a #run method

[code language="ruby"]
def run
get_page
get_info_blocks
get_category_and_lesson_titles
end
[/code]

Then put in LessonsScraper.new.run into my seeds file and ran it through the rake command rake db:seed. Presto. had my categories and lessons all ported in with automatic relationships established.

S. wait those titles have a bunch of junk data i dont need like time completed and stuff.

Q: I need to parse the titles to standardize their actual names, should I do that now or later?

A. LATER CUZ PROCRASTINATION. That's not actually the reason but do it later. As of now we'll get by with the names, but the time data could be important in the future so we don't need to delete it from the records just yet. But yes, create a parse_title class method for the Lesson class.

Knowing that some of the titles had the amount of time it took to complete them and others had dashes at the end instead, I setup this blanket parsing instance method using regex that wouldn't change the database entry in case I wanted that information for another project

[code language="ruby"]

def parse_title
#if title.match(/(\-)/)
#title = self.title.gsub(&amp;amp;amp;quot;-&amp;amp;amp;quot;, &amp;amp;amp;quot;&amp;amp;amp;quot;)######(/^[\w+\s+\w]*/)
if title.match(/(\d)/) || title.match(/(-)/)
title.gsub(&amp;amp;amp;quot;-&amp;amp;amp;quot;, &amp;amp;amp;quot;&amp;amp;amp;quot;).match(/^\D+/)
##not going to change titles until i know what information i want
##on here
else
title
end
end

[/code]

S. all comments in a place looks fine, but all ratings look weird together

Q. How should I group ratings?

A. an instance method that will get you the average rating!

I put #average_rating in two different models both Category and Lesson, which works due to their has_many relationship with comments.

[code language="ruby"]

 def average_rating
 if ratings.count != 0
 average = 0
 total = 0
 ratings.each do |num|
 total += num.star_rating.to_f
 end
 average = total / ratings.count
 else
 "N/A"
 end
 end

[/code]

Further more to find the most difficult category and lesson I created class methods .hardest_category and .hardest_lesson, then built out a route to the show route, which only renders the selected lesson. You can see below how in the query method i first create a new array filled with all the different category objects, then I select all the categories that have ratings, and place them into a new array, rated_categories. Afterwords I sort rated_categories by their average_rating and call the first object. Replace category with lesson, and there is my hardest_lesson method!

[code language="ruby"]

def self.hardest_category
 all_categories = Category.all
 rated_categories = all_categories.select do |category|
 category.ratings.count != 0
 end

 rated_categories.sort{|category| category.average_rating}.first
 end
end
<pre>[/code]

S. I want god like powers over my rails domain, but make sure no one else can.

Q: How do I become a god?

A. enum role[:user, :vip, :admin] add a column migration to the users :role as integer and then add enum role [whatever ] to your user model class. default in the migration whatever you want your default to be. then set yourself using rails console or build out a view that allows any user to make themselves a higher power.

I didn't want to make normal users able to set themselves as gods _right off  the sign up_ so I made it that only those that sign in through github are admins.

S. with these god like powers i now need to see my subjects

Q. How do i become omniscient?

A: We haven't built out a user's controller due to devise taking care of all the routing. But now let's create one so that we can make a user index page that only admin's can access. We can use Pundit, to ensure that anyone can see their own or other people profiles  only admin's have access to the index all with the ability to eliminate each one of them.

[Pundit's](https://github.com/elabs/pundit) a fantastic tool, I still have yet to get the complete hang of it though. Here I've used it to prevent users from modifying other user's comments and ratings, unless they are VIPS, in which they can delete others ratings and comments, or they're admins which means they can edit and/or delete both user profiles and their comments and ratings. I used a simple conditional verifying that it was the admin? or redirecting them back to the referrer. These policies are outlined in my policies folder and all inherit from the default application_policy.rb

[code language="ruby"]

class ApplicationPolicy
attr_reader :user, :record

def initialize(user, record)
@user = user
@record = record
end

def index?
false
end

def show?
scope.where(:id => record.id).exists?
end

def create?
false
end

def new?
create?
end

def update?
false
end

def edit?
update?
end

def destroy?
false
end

def scope
Pundit.policy_scope!(user, record.class)
end

class Scope
attr_reader :user, :scope

def initialize(user, scope)
@user = user
@scope = scope
end

def resolve
scope
end
end
end

[/code]

the attribute user, refers to #current_user  and record refers to whatever object the current_user is interacting with.

[code language="ruby"]

class CommentPolicy <ApplicationPolicy
attr_reader :user, :record

def create?
user
end

def update?
user.admin? or record.user_id == user.id
end

def destroy?
user.admin? or user.vip? or record.user_id == user.id
end
end

[/code]

The comment policy and rating policies are the same, so to review them you can see, that any user can create a comment, yet only admins or the current users, whose id matches the records(which in this case refers to comment)'s foreign key user_id.

[code language="ruby"]

class UserPolicy < ApplicationPolicy
attr_reader :user, :record

def index?
user.admin?
end

def promote?
user.admin?
end

def show?
user.admin? or user.vip? or record.id == user.id
end

def destroy?
user.admin? or record.id == user.id
end
end

[/code]

Our user_policy.rb goes a step farther, and makes it that only admins can see a full user list via the index page or promote/demote users. To fully use these policies the only other thing that I need to ensure is to add

authorize @record (where record is the instance under question) after the controller methods that respond to the policy methods for pundit to authorize the user.

S. people won't think its impressive unless it looks cool, it needs to look cool

Q. How do i become cool .

answer: add some bootstrap to that DATA! fixed navbar always looks nice. as well as some dynamic links that appear if you're logged in or if you're the admin

There are enough forums online on bootstrap that sped me through this process that are shallow enough not to get sucked in. I tidied things up and added a drop down menu. Nothing too nice, but added the requirements to continue prettifying it. I followed this post pretty closely to guide my way through adding an easy fixed-navbar https://www.rubyplus.com/articles/1371.



Granted, I was not this organized and I fell deep into the ABYSS this round (if you'd like to see my [journey](https://rubydoobiedoo.wordpress.com/2016/03/17/my-initial-road-map-for-rails/) and type in "ABYSS"). BUT, that's what makes this all so interesting. the realm of possibilities. The ABYSS isn't an enemy nor is it a friend. It's a force of nature that must be treated with respect and treaded carefully. You can always wander in, and you'll need to venture in during most likely every single project you commit. Anything can be done with Rails, and all of the solutions are there at your finger tips. But unless your just going spelunking I recommend you make a roadmap before you start your next trip.

                            The beauty of rails is it _can be_ incredibly straightforward and simplistic, with all the functions that you require out of a powerful web application. Authentification? The [devise gem](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) is at your beck and call. Authorization? [Pundit](https://github.com/elabs/pundit) or [CanCanCan](https://github.com/CanCanCommunity/cancancan) will keep those policy scope methods nice and tidy. You want a pretty front-end? [Bootstra](http://getbootstrap.com)ps got you covered. Anything else that you might hate doing by hand? Rails can generate it. There are thousands of features that are all available at a click of the mouse....and that's what makes Rails difficult, not stating what you need, or asking then asking the questions on how to do something, but the unnerving search through the depth of answers for the solution that best fits the scenario. ![giphy](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/giphy.gif)Having run into this a lot during programming I've begun calling this depth of programming knowledge "ABYSS" or

Absolutely

Beyond

Your

Shit

Solutions.

I built out a review site with a simple bootstrap front-end where you can rate and comment on the Flatiron School's  Learn-Verified Full Stack Web Development Course and then allows users to rate the lessons in difficulty as well as add comments to each lesson that can then be viewed by visitors and users.

If you'd like to follow along with my project the repo can be found [here](https://github.com/pajamaw/lv_lesson_review).

The walkthrough:

The greatest obstacle I run into with rails is getting lost in the ABYSS (the same issue I brought up earlier)

.![giphy (1)](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/giphy-1.gif)

There are SO MANY GODDAMN ways to answer a question. I've lost friends and family to the ABYSS after they stumbled into stackoverflow forums looking for  the correct form_tag to use. Because of the ABYSS, the first step in any project, is to create a workflow. I can't get over how extremely important this is if you'd like to maintain your sanity and prevent getting lost in the ABYSS along the way.

There are several ways to setup a workflow. The best way, imho, is through TDD or BDD depending on what you're used to. I'm talking about using testing suites like  cucumber, selenium, capybara, rspec, or the dozens of others that force you to sit down and write down what you want, then write down what you require to get there, so that you can then create it this allows you to navigate the abyss if you need an answer, solve the problem and then most importantly, _ move on_.

Despite my belief in testing, I chose what I believe is the second best method (which resulted in the project taking longer than I expected),  s0 I wrote a list in the following fashion.

WHAT AM I BUILDING HERE:

you're building a review application for the Learn Verified courses, pj.

WHAT DO I NEED

Statement: The lessons, there are literally hundreds of them that I'm not manually putting in by hand

Question: Well how do i scrape it then?

Answer: build out a Scraper, then scrape that DATA.

I used the mechanize gem on the which uses  Nokogiri and URI to open and parse web pages, with some added features, such as the ability to fill out forms, click buttons and more! After i found my desired page with its css tags I made the following

[code language="ruby"]
def agent
agent = Mechanize.new
end

def get_page
page = agent.get('http://www.learn.co/pajamaw.html')
end

def lesson_titles
page.search(&amp;amp;amp;quot;.lesson td span&amp;amp;amp;quot;).collect{|title| title.text}
end
[/code]

which allowed for me to grab all of the lesson titles here.

S. There needs to be organization among those lists,

Q. How do I organize it?

A. build it out so that you scrape the categories as well. I used Mechanize for the webpage parsing and the IRB to find the right selections then created the following.

To do this I had to change my outlook from getting a bunch of individual lessons, to I need to get a each category, with all of its lessons.

[code language="ruby"]

def get_info_blocks
info = get_page.search('div[data-topic-slug]')
end

def get_category_and_lesson_titles
get_info_blocks.each do |lesson_block|
if lesson_block.css('div div h3').text != &amp;amp;amp;quot;&amp;amp;amp;quot;
@category = Category.new(title: lesson_block.css('div div h3').text)
lesson_block.css('tr.lesson').each do |lesson|
@lesson = Lesson.new(title: lesson.text)
@lesson.category_id = @category.id
@category.lessons &amp;amp;amp;lt;&amp;amp;amp;lt; @lesson
@category.save
@lesson.save
end
end
end

[/code]

Nice I've got the data! We'll hold on to that for later now.

S. I need users.

Q. How do I make users?

A. [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise), Baby!

After you throw in the devise gem into your gemfile and bundle install, devise will set EVERYTHING UP FOR YOU. i shit you not. type in 'rails g devise:install' and then follow the prompt for the whatever else you want to setup through it. it's magic.

S. I need users to have comments and ratings and I need categories which will have lessons, which I want nested to also have those same comments and ratings.

Q. How do I create all these models and their controllers ?

A. You just do.

Literally though. for this just start putting down some 'rails g' actions. Whichever ones you prefer to generate the necessary components. I personally go for the 'rails g resource' generators because it creates your migration files, your models, and your users, without adding any unnecessary crud actions and routes that you might not use, as well as setting up a blanket resources: "class" route. then setup your associations. as opposed to my [Sinatra Project](https://rubydoobiedoo.wordpress.com/2016/03/02/pedigree-sinatra-ar-mvc-app/) where I was using self-joins and lots of other fun stuff, this time we had our basic belongs_to and has_many relationships.  User has_many comments and ratings. Categories has many Lessons and has many ratings and comments through lessons. Ratings and comments both belongs_to a lesson and a user. I setup all of my foreign_key relationships (all of the models with belongs to gets a foreign key!) I migrated.

S. This is essentially a site for LV students right? I need authentification to ensure that people from LV can come in to become users, while others cannot, I also need to make sure that the users dont screw with other  users things.

Q. How can i ensure that LV are the only ones, and also make sure every user keeps his hands to himself?

A. well can't make them login with their LV credentials (actually i could if i used the student scraper from my [karma project](https://rubydoobiedoo.wordpress.com/2016/02/13/my-first-gem/) and then students would authenticate with omniauth but every github authentification had a final check to make sure they were also a stud...AHHH NICE TRY, ABYSS) but i can make sure they at least have a github account so github-omniauth for verification. While I can use pundit for to make sure that user's don't play with others things.

Omniauth is literally just magic. I've used the Facebook Omniauth and the Github omniauth and I found the github one much less buggy, may have just been lucky chance though. **[https://www.codementor.io/ruby-on-rails/tutorial/rails-omniauth-with-devise--github-example](https://www.codementor.io/ruby-on-rails/tutorial/rails-omniauth-with-devise--github-example) **I followed this guide to a T. As for ensuring everyone keeps their hands off of each other's belongings I setup 

[code language="ruby"]

 private
#app/controllers/application_controller.rb

 def user_not_authorized
 flash[:alert] = "You are not authorized to perform this action."
 redirect_to root_path
 end

 def require_login
 unless logged_in?
 flash[:alert] = "You must be logged in to access this section"
 redirect_to new_user_session_path 
 end
 end

 def logged_in?
 !!current_user
 end

end

[/code]



I use the #user_not_authorized to create a custom error which rescues a user from breaking the program and submits an error to the window and redirects them when they access something they don't have permissions to. These policies are included by including Pundit. Pundit authorizations are stored in my policies folder, which compartmentalizes all of my authorization models and methods for users. This prevent users from touching objects that don't include their own user.id., unless they have special privileges due to their role that I accounted for in my other policy files (we'll get to those soon). The #require_login method, I then use through before_filter :require_login in my different controller methods where I first want to ensure that all visitors of the site are users, offering a distinct error from when users are not authorized to view or commit certain actions.



S. KK I've got that data about the categories and the lessons but i need to port it into the database now.

Q. How do I port it into the database? Should I hop aboard the one-by-one form_train?

A. NOPE GET OFF THE FORM TRAIN. Build that DATA into a class, with methods that instantiate each Lesson and their categories, and then a method that runs all of the processes. Call that class in your db/seeds.db file. then rake commands baby!

I've never built out a seed data like this before and it was surprisingly difficult to find a forum online that explained it out. So I just assumed it would work out if i called a new scraper instantiation and called run on it...which it did! I took those methods that we looked at earlier and bundled them in a #run method

[code language="ruby"]
def run
get_page
get_info_blocks
get_category_and_lesson_titles
end
[/code]

Then put in LessonsScraper.new.run into my seeds file and ran it through the rake command rake db:seed. Presto. had my categories and lessons all ported in with automatic relationships established.

S. wait those titles have a bunch of junk data i dont need like time completed and stuff.

Q: I need to parse the titles to standardize their actual names, should I do that now or later?

A. LATER CUZ PROCRASTINATION. That's not actually the reason but do it later. As of now we'll get by with the names, but the time data could be important in the future so we don't need to delete it from the records just yet. But yes, create a parse_title class method for the Lesson class.

Knowing that some of the titles had the amount of time it took to complete them and others had dashes at the end instead, I setup this blanket parsing instance method using regex that wouldn't change the database entry in case I wanted that information for another project

[code language="ruby"]

def parse_title
#if title.match(/(\-)/)
#title = self.title.gsub(&amp;amp;amp;quot;-&amp;amp;amp;quot;, &amp;amp;amp;quot;&amp;amp;amp;quot;)######(/^[\w+\s+\w]*/)
if title.match(/(\d)/) || title.match(/(-)/)
title.gsub(&amp;amp;amp;quot;-&amp;amp;amp;quot;, &amp;amp;amp;quot;&amp;amp;amp;quot;).match(/^\D+/)
##not going to change titles until i know what information i want
##on here
else
title
end
end

[/code]

S. all comments in a place looks fine, but all ratings look weird together

Q. How should I group ratings?

A. an instance method that will get you the average rating!

I put #average_rating in two different models both Category and Lesson, which works due to their has_many relationship with comments.

[code language="ruby"]

 def average_rating
 if ratings.count != 0
 average = 0
 total = 0
 ratings.each do |num|
 total += num.star_rating.to_f
 end
 average = total / ratings.count
 else
 "N/A"
 end
 end

[/code]

Further more to find the most difficult category and lesson I created class methods .hardest_category and .hardest_lesson, then built out a route to the show route, which only renders the selected lesson. You can see below how in the query method i first create a new array filled with all the different category objects, then I select all the categories that have ratings, and place them into a new array, rated_categories. Afterwords I sort rated_categories by their average_rating and call the first object. Replace category with lesson, and there is my hardest_lesson method!

[code language="ruby"]

def self.hardest_category
 all_categories = Category.all
 rated_categories = all_categories.select do |category|
 category.ratings.count != 0
 end

 rated_categories.sort{|category| category.average_rating}.first
 end
end
<pre>[/code]

S. I want god like powers over my rails domain, but make sure no one else can.

Q: How do I become a god?

A. enum role[:user, :vip, :admin] add a column migration to the users :role as integer and then add enum role [whatever ] to your user model class. default in the migration whatever you want your default to be. then set yourself using rails console or build out a view that allows any user to make themselves a higher power.

I didn't want to make normal users able to set themselves as gods _right off  the sign up_ so I made it that only those that sign in through github are admins.

S. with these god like powers i now need to see my subjects

Q. How do i become omniscient?

A: We haven't built out a user's controller due to devise taking care of all the routing. But now let's create one so that we can make a user index page that only admin's can access. We can use Pundit, to ensure that anyone can see their own or other people profiles  only admin's have access to the index all with the ability to eliminate each one of them.

[Pundit's](https://github.com/elabs/pundit) a fantastic tool, I still have yet to get the complete hang of it though. Here I've used it to prevent users from modifying other user's comments and ratings, unless they are VIPS, in which they can delete others ratings and comments, or they're admins which means they can edit and/or delete both user profiles and their comments and ratings. I used a simple conditional verifying that it was the admin? or redirecting them back to the referrer. These policies are outlined in my policies folder and all inherit from the default application_policy.rb

[code language="ruby"]

class ApplicationPolicy
attr_reader :user, :record

def initialize(user, record)
@user = user
@record = record
end

def index?
false
end

def show?
scope.where(:id => record.id).exists?
end

def create?
false
end

def new?
create?
end

def update?
false
end

def edit?
update?
end

def destroy?
false
end

def scope
Pundit.policy_scope!(user, record.class)
end

class Scope
attr_reader :user, :scope

def initialize(user, scope)
@user = user
@scope = scope
end

def resolve
scope
end
end
end

[/code]

the attribute user, refers to #current_user  and record refers to whatever object the current_user is interacting with.

[code language="ruby"]

class CommentPolicy <ApplicationPolicy
attr_reader :user, :record

def create?
user
end

def update?
user.admin? or record.user_id == user.id
end

def destroy?
user.admin? or user.vip? or record.user_id == user.id
end
end

[/code]

The comment policy and rating policies are the same, so to review them you can see, that any user can create a comment, yet only admins or the current users, whose id matches the records(which in this case refers to comment)'s foreign key user_id.

[code language="ruby"]

class UserPolicy < ApplicationPolicy
attr_reader :user, :record

def index?
user.admin?
end

def promote?
user.admin?
end

def show?
user.admin? or user.vip? or record.id == user.id
end

def destroy?
user.admin? or record.id == user.id
end
end

[/code]

Our user_policy.rb goes a step farther, and makes it that only admins can see a full user list via the index page or promote/demote users. To fully use these policies the only other thing that I need to ensure is to add

authorize @record (where record is the instance under question) after the controller methods that respond to the policy methods for pundit to authorize the user.

S. people won't think its impressive unless it looks cool, it needs to look cool

Q. How do i become cool .

answer: add some bootstrap to that DATA! fixed navbar always looks nice. as well as some dynamic links that appear if you're logged in or if you're the admin

There are enough forums online on bootstrap that sped me through this process that are shallow enough not to get sucked in. I tidied things up and added a drop down menu. Nothing too nice, but added the requirements to continue prettifying it. I followed this post pretty closely to guide my way through adding an easy fixed-navbar https://www.rubyplus.com/articles/1371.



Granted, I was not this organized and I fell deep into the ABYSS this round (if you'd like to see my [journey](https://rubydoobiedoo.wordpress.com/2016/03/17/my-initial-road-map-for-rails/) and type in "ABYSS"). BUT, that's what makes this all so interesting. the realm of possibilities. The ABYSS isn't an enemy nor is it a friend. It's a force of nature that must be treated with respect and treaded carefully. You can always wander in, and you'll need to venture in during most likely every single project you commit. Anything can be done with Rails, and all of the solutions are there at your finger tips. But unless your just going spelunking I recommend you make a roadmap before you start your next trip.

                            For the longest time I've wanted to create an extensive family tree. Even before I was coding. My family's large enough to the point where it's now a family joke when someone knew comes around that they're probably just as closely related to us as some of our other "cousins".

But that's the beauty of a large Italian family.

There are two basic ways to think of and work with applications and each has its own advantages and disadvantages.

I started writing definitions for these but then I realized that Wikipedia does a way better job. So here's what wikipedia has to say about the methods



	
  1. Outside-in


"Of all the [agile software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) methodologies, **outside–in software development** takes a different approach to optimizing the software development process. Unlike other approaches, **outside–in** development focuses on satisfying the needs of stakeholders. The underlying theory behind outside–in software is that to create successful software, you must have a clear understanding of the goals and motivations of your stakeholders. Your ultimate goal is to produce software that is highly [consumable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumability) and meets/exceeds the needs of your client."

2. Inside-Out

"Inside-Out (Classic school, _bottom-up_): you begin at component/class level (inside) and add tests to requirements. As the code evolves (due to refactorings), new collaborators, interactions and other components appear. TDD guides the design completely."(http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/166409/tdd-outside-in-vs-inside-out)

So to summarize it. Both are schools of thought that focus on Test Driven Development. Yet, Outside in focuses on consumer side first and then makes the program work. While Inside-out focuses server-side of making the program work then ensuring the consumer's needs are filled.

Being the end user and the programmer, and not having a perfect idea of how to start I'd argue that unless you're extremely confident , working TDD Inside-Out is far more advantageous and will likely not only save your computer from the fury of your wrathful hands after hours of fruitless debugging, but also will make working in groups significantly smoother.  This project begins by establishing your file structure and your database tables. But _even__ before that_. Before you open a new file! M V C. what will your models' relationships with each other be?

![Screenshot 2016-03-02 00.26.29](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/screenshot-2016-03-02-00-26-29.png)

A User has_many :family_trees and has_many :individuals, through: family trees

Family_tree has_many :individuals and belongs_to :user

Individual belongs_to :family_tree

Seems straightforward enough.



In order I needed to :



	
  1. Created the file structure with environment, config.ru,

	
    * gemfile (tux should be BOLDED AND PAINTED...absolutely essential when working with AR and databases)![Screenshot 2016-03-02 00.54.14](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/screenshot-2016-03-02-00-54-14.png)

	
    * rakefile with custom commands in order to make use of the console command ![Screenshot 2016-03-02 00.52.32](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/screenshot-2016-03-02-00-52-32.png)




	
  2. Create basic classes with their model belongs_to/has_many relationships.*![Screenshot 2016-03-02 00.29.16](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/screenshot-2016-03-02-00-29-16.png)

	
    1. Running through it one by one you can see how I laid out my classes and my relationships.

	
      1. The User class makes use of #validates as well as #has_secure_password from the 'btcrypt' gem which I used to encrypt my users passwords.

	
      2. The FamilyTree class is fairly straightforward.

	
      3. Individual class was tough. Initially I was planning on having multiple tables for all the familial relationships but I kept coming back to the same issue _I need to join with myself_. Despite the disturbing imagery that gives to some, I wasn't aware that this was in fact a very common occurrence which can be handled as I did called "THE SELF JOIN"

	
        * Now the self join works by adding additional foreign keys into your class and assigning them to symbols that I can then call later on to access the "Individual" stored. ![Screenshot 2016-03-02 01.08.52.png](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/screenshot-2016-03-02-01-08-52.png)You can see here how the :childs_mother, symbol now represents the instance where the foreign_key: mother_id comes from.

	
        * To finish the dynamic relationship that the individual has with itself the three other fields that were added that the individual can also :belongs_to![Screenshot 2016-03-02 01.12.20.png](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/screenshot-2016-03-02-01-12-20.png)Now when called upon the mother or father that I've assigned to an individual via the foreign keys can be accessed.




	
      4. So by adding a few extra lines to my Individual class and adding 3 additional foreign keys (not including the family_tree fk) I am now able to create helper methods that can easily extend the scope of my pedigree from nuclear family to full extended family through the relations between :spouse, :mother, :father







	
  3. Create the basic forms for Users so that I have the params to create new users. *

	
  4. migrate my users table*

	
  5. Write the user_controller*

	
    1. 

	
      * Once again remembering and testing the #validates method so that bad data is not created.

	
      * Now also becomes the time to test the helper methods and authentification that enforce the private sessions of users ![Screenshot 2016-03-02 01.21.34.png](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/screenshot-2016-03-02-01-21-34.png)

	
      * the session id is stored and created after login and signup via

	
        1. session[:id] = user.id










	
  6. Create the basic forms for family_tree so that i have the params to create new family_tree instances*

	
  7. Write the family_tree controller*

	
    * very similar to the userscontroller barring one exception which i had yet to add(but thinking over as I'm writing this, I'll definitely do tomorrow) is the delete route.

	
    * ![Screenshot 2016-03-02 01.40.53.png](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/screenshot-2016-03-02-01-40-53.png)

	
      * it can definitely be tidied up but it works now. You can see at the top where I stop anyone from deleting the instance if it doesn't belong to them. This is a simple method I use throughout all of my controllers.

	
      * The method below that uses the #select iteration to compile all of the individuals that belong to that specific tree. I then delete them all systematically and then afterwards delete the tree instance itself.







	
  8. Create the basic forms for individuals so that i have the params to create new individuals for the family tree*

	
    1. These were more complicated than the other two simply due to the number of times they were modified in order to work with the system.

	
      * the only two fields i required for the instances were the :name and :gender fields. after debating about whether to use a boolean datatype I decided that using a string datatype and then the <input= type="radio"> was the best method to prevent bad data by only allowing two options.![Screenshot 2016-03-02 01.47.41.png](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/screenshot-2016-03-02-01-47-41.png)![Screenshot 2016-03-02 01.50.10.png](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/screenshot-2016-03-02-01-50-10.png)

	
      * 






	
  9. Write the individuals controller*

	
    1. This was the bulk of the work.

	
    2. though it got significantly easier as soon as I setup my final version of the Individuals Table in the db.

	
    3. Each time an in any field is made a new instance of individual is created and automatically associated with the relationship titles of :spouse, :father, and :mother.

	
    4. And if the params matches a current instance, the relationship is automatically associated.

Outside-in requires a fairly strong idea of not only what you're going to build, but also of the many different ways its possible to create it. For those that are just starting off coding, it will probably seem like a daunting task. Going step-by-step with Inside-Out may take longer at the end of the day, but ensuring that each model works before moving on to the next model will make for a much smoother transition when you're coding alone and especially if you're working in groups.

                            For the longest time I've wanted to create an extensive family tree. Even before I was coding. My family's large enough to the point where it's now a family joke when someone knew comes around that they're probably just as closely related to us as some of our other "cousins".

But that's the beauty of a large Italian family.

There are two basic ways to think of and work with applications and each has its own advantages and disadvantages.

I started writing definitions for these but then I realized that Wikipedia does a way better job. So here's what wikipedia has to say about the methods



	
  1. Outside-in


"Of all the [agile software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) methodologies, **outside–in software development** takes a different approach to optimizing the software development process. Unlike other approaches, **outside–in** development focuses on satisfying the needs of stakeholders. The underlying theory behind outside–in software is that to create successful software, you must have a clear understanding of the goals and motivations of your stakeholders. Your ultimate goal is to produce software that is highly [consumable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumability) and meets/exceeds the needs of your client."

2. Inside-Out

"Inside-Out (Classic school, _bottom-up_): you begin at component/class level (inside) and add tests to requirements. As the code evolves (due to refactorings), new collaborators, interactions and other components appear. TDD guides the design completely."(http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/166409/tdd-outside-in-vs-inside-out)

So to summarize it. Both are schools of thought that focus on Test Driven Development. Yet, Outside in focuses on consumer side first and then makes the program work. While Inside-out focuses server-side of making the program work then ensuring the consumer's needs are filled.

Being the end user and the programmer, and not having a perfect idea of how to start I'd argue that unless you're extremely confident , working TDD Inside-Out is far more advantageous and will likely not only save your computer from the fury of your wrathful hands after hours of fruitless debugging, but also will make working in groups significantly smoother.  This project begins by establishing your file structure and your database tables. But _even__ before that_. Before you open a new file! M V C. what will your models' relationships with each other be?

![Screenshot 2016-03-02 00.26.29](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/screenshot-2016-03-02-00-26-29.png)

A User has_many :family_trees and has_many :individuals, through: family trees

Family_tree has_many :individuals and belongs_to :user

Individual belongs_to :family_tree

Seems straightforward enough.



In order I needed to :



	
  1. Created the file structure with environment, config.ru,

	
    * gemfile (tux should be BOLDED AND PAINTED...absolutely essential when working with AR and databases)![Screenshot 2016-03-02 00.54.14](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/screenshot-2016-03-02-00-54-14.png)

	
    * rakefile with custom commands in order to make use of the console command ![Screenshot 2016-03-02 00.52.32](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/screenshot-2016-03-02-00-52-32.png)




	
  2. Create basic classes with their model belongs_to/has_many relationships.*![Screenshot 2016-03-02 00.29.16](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/screenshot-2016-03-02-00-29-16.png)

	
    1. Running through it one by one you can see how I laid out my classes and my relationships.

	
      1. The User class makes use of #validates as well as #has_secure_password from the 'btcrypt' gem which I used to encrypt my users passwords.

	
      2. The FamilyTree class is fairly straightforward.

	
      3. Individual class was tough. Initially I was planning on having multiple tables for all the familial relationships but I kept coming back to the same issue _I need to join with myself_. Despite the disturbing imagery that gives to some, I wasn't aware that this was in fact a very common occurrence which can be handled as I did called "THE SELF JOIN"

	
        * Now the self join works by adding additional foreign keys into your class and assigning them to symbols that I can then call later on to access the "Individual" stored. ![Screenshot 2016-03-02 01.08.52.png](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/screenshot-2016-03-02-01-08-52.png)You can see here how the :childs_mother, symbol now represents the instance where the foreign_key: mother_id comes from.

	
        * To finish the dynamic relationship that the individual has with itself the three other fields that were added that the individual can also :belongs_to![Screenshot 2016-03-02 01.12.20.png](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/screenshot-2016-03-02-01-12-20.png)Now when called upon the mother or father that I've assigned to an individual via the foreign keys can be accessed.




	
      4. So by adding a few extra lines to my Individual class and adding 3 additional foreign keys (not including the family_tree fk) I am now able to create helper methods that can easily extend the scope of my pedigree from nuclear family to full extended family through the relations between :spouse, :mother, :father







	
  3. Create the basic forms for Users so that I have the params to create new users. *

	
  4. migrate my users table*

	
  5. Write the user_controller*

	
    1. 

	
      * Once again remembering and testing the #validates method so that bad data is not created.

	
      * Now also becomes the time to test the helper methods and authentification that enforce the private sessions of users ![Screenshot 2016-03-02 01.21.34.png](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/screenshot-2016-03-02-01-21-34.png)

	
      * the session id is stored and created after login and signup via

	
        1. session[:id] = user.id










	
  6. Create the basic forms for family_tree so that i have the params to create new family_tree instances*

	
  7. Write the family_tree controller*

	
    * very similar to the userscontroller barring one exception which i had yet to add(but thinking over as I'm writing this, I'll definitely do tomorrow) is the delete route.

	
    * ![Screenshot 2016-03-02 01.40.53.png](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/screenshot-2016-03-02-01-40-53.png)

	
      * it can definitely be tidied up but it works now. You can see at the top where I stop anyone from deleting the instance if it doesn't belong to them. This is a simple method I use throughout all of my controllers.

	
      * The method below that uses the #select iteration to compile all of the individuals that belong to that specific tree. I then delete them all systematically and then afterwards delete the tree instance itself.







	
  8. Create the basic forms for individuals so that i have the params to create new individuals for the family tree*

	
    1. These were more complicated than the other two simply due to the number of times they were modified in order to work with the system.

	
      * the only two fields i required for the instances were the :name and :gender fields. after debating about whether to use a boolean datatype I decided that using a string datatype and then the <input= type="radio"> was the best method to prevent bad data by only allowing two options.![Screenshot 2016-03-02 01.47.41.png](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/screenshot-2016-03-02-01-47-41.png)![Screenshot 2016-03-02 01.50.10.png](https://rubydoobiedoo.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/screenshot-2016-03-02-01-50-10.png)

	
      * 






	
  9. Write the individuals controller*

	
    1. This was the bulk of the work.

	
    2. though it got significantly easier as soon as I setup my final version of the Individuals Table in the db.

	
    3. Each time an in any field is made a new instance of individual is created and automatically associated with the relationship titles of :spouse, :father, and :mother.

	
    4. And if the params matches a current instance, the relationship is automatically associated.

	
      * The next step here is creating another radio form that takes all of the instances of Individaul from that @family_tree so that instead of remembering to type out a name perfectly , you can simply press a radio or if you choose to you can add an additional instance.




	
    5. Setting up the GUI so that it looked like the image above allowed me to easily create relationships in a bottom-up manner.

	
      1. At this point my job was done, I had created a working prototype, but it lacked any one outside of father, mother, spouse. so using helper methods I expanded the range of the family.

                            Hello There!

After a nearly a month of putting it off, I finally sat down to create my first ruby gem. Now, this wasn't the _very_ first time that I had the resolve to do so, but it is the first time that I saw it entirely to its completion.

And it feels great! The whole reason I dove headfirst back into programming was so that I could start building again....sure I've built out web scrapers and various other applications similar to this gem prior to it in my coursework, but this one was special. Not only was it my idea to build-but the reason that I built it out was simply because I thought it would take too long to do by hand!

Basically, I built my first gem out of laziness.

The process itself is extremely straightforward. By the  running


// ♥ bundle gem your_new_gem




Bundler (assuming you have rubygems installed) creates and initializes a new file structure skeleton for your new gem. One of the most important pieces of it is the gemspec file that it creates for you.





###### **Gem::Specification.new do |gem|**
** gem.name = 'karma_count'**
** gem.version = '0.0.0'**
** gem.date = Date.today.to_s**

** gem.author = ["PJ Wickwire"]**
** gem.email = 'pjpeterww@gmail.com'**
** gem.files = ["lib/karma_count.rb", "lib/cli.rb", "lib/scraper.rb", "lib/student.rb", "bin/karma"]**

** gem.summary = "A gem to list out all the learn-verified students karma points"**
** gem.homepage = 'http://github.com/pajamaw'**
** gem.licenses = 'MIT'**

** gem.executables << 'karma'**




###### **end**


The layout will look something along the lines of this. This last line you see the "executables" is the line that allows you to run your gem from $PATH. In order to do that the only thing you need to ensure is that you have a shebang line in your bin folder where your application is run.

Moving on, the job of karma_count is to scrape the learn-verified students' profiles in order to store and then list their "karma" points. Karma points are points awarded for helping other students out with technical issues that they're facing.

I was talking with my friend about those that were ahead of us in the course and figured that those that were farther ahead of us helped others out less in order to get through the material faster. My friend thought the opposite, saying that they must get bored if they're getting through it so fast and so they probably help out because they simply like the challenge! With that in mind I sought out everyone's karma!

Using Nokogiri and open-uri I scraped a site which we previously were tasked with which had each students name and github url's. The github url's were necessary because the path of each url was the path for the next student site that had the karma data that I required.


###### def add_student_attributes(attributes_hash)
attributes_hash.each do |k,v|
self.send(("#{k}="), v)
end
end


After initializing all of the students with hashtributes I scraped and stored their profile information into the corresponding student instances using the above code with  #send.

With that data I then had the necessary tools to scrape their profiles for karma.


###### 




###### def self.scrape_profile_page(profile_url)
specific_student = {}
begin
doc = Nokogiri::HTML(open(profile_url))
rescue
specific_student[:github_url] = nil
else
doc.search(".social-icon-container a").each do |social|
if social.attribute("href").value.scan(/github.com/) == ["github.com"]
specific_student[:github_url] = social.attribute("href").value
else
specific_student[:github_url] = nil
end
end
end
specific_student
end




###### def self.scrape_learn_for_karma(github_url)
specific_karma = {}
if github_url != nil
gh_parse = URI::parse(github_url)
learn_url = "https://www.learn.co" + gh_parse.path + ".html"
begin
doc = Nokogiri::HTML(open(learn_url))
rescue
specific_karma[:karma] = nil
else
points = doc.css(".karma-points h3").text.to_i
specific_karma[:karma] = points
end
else
specific_karma[:karma] = nil
end
specific_karma
end


These methods I used to scrape the information consecutively. Breaking the methods down you can see how each works.



	
  1. I set each blank hash awaiting attributes

	
  2. I then use the begin and rescue methods while I open and parse the url's. The rescue method prevents the program from stopping if it encounters a bad gateway.

	
  3. I then use css selectors to grab the data that I need.

	
  4. Set the data to the hash, rinse and repeat!


The karma method works in a similar fashion while using the URI::parse(x) method. This method parses out a url into its components i.e. its domain, path, query, etc. This was simpler than regex and made sure that I got what I wanted.

After self.send ing the attributes to the instances I've got my final dataset.

I created a simple CLI that respawned a new screen with every command by using system 'clear' at the beginning of my header method like so:


###### def header
system 'clear'
puts "______WELCOME TO THE KARMA COUNT____"
end


With my simple CLI in place all I needed was to be able to access and manipulate the data. As it was the first version of my first gem, I just needed it to work.


###### def all_karma
header
competitors = Student.all.select do |student|
student.karma if !(student.karma.nil? )
end
competitors.sort_by!{|student| student.karma}
puts "_______________KARMA HIGH SCORE_____________"
competitors.reverse.each_with_index do |student, index|
puts ""
puts " #{index.to_i.next}. #{student.name.upcase} from #{student.location} with #{student.karma} POINTS!"
puts "------------------------------------------------"
end


So to iterate over the array of of instances I used #select to immediately only grab the students that had karma != nil. So any of those that encountered bad gateways were immediately taken out of the scoreboard.

I used #sort_by! to change the competitors array in place and finished by using #reverse to label the students from highest to lowest while using #each_with_index so that the program could count out each for itself.

After adding a few more features such as search functions and a top 10. After I was sure that it worked (despite the speed) I completed the gem with gem push. This pushed the current commits up to rubygems which then listed it as a finished gem product ready to download.

                            Hello There!

After a nearly a month of putting it off, I finally sat down to create my first ruby gem. Now, this wasn't the _very_ first time that I had the resolve to do so, but it is the first time that I saw it entirely to its completion.

And it feels great! The whole reason I dove headfirst back into programming was so that I could start building again....sure I've built out web scrapers and various other applications similar to this gem prior to it in my coursework, but this one was special. Not only was it my idea to build-but the reason that I built it out was simply because I thought it would take too long to do by hand!

Basically, I built my first gem out of laziness.

The process itself is extremely straightforward. By the  running


// ♥ bundle gem your_new_gem




Bundler (assuming you have rubygems installed) creates and initializes a new file structure skeleton for your new gem. One of the most important pieces of it is the gemspec file that it creates for you.





###### **Gem::Specification.new do |gem|**
** gem.name = 'karma_count'**
** gem.version = '0.0.0'**
** gem.date = Date.today.to_s**

** gem.author = ["PJ Wickwire"]**
** gem.email = 'pjpeterww@gmail.com'**
** gem.files = ["lib/karma_count.rb", "lib/cli.rb", "lib/scraper.rb", "lib/student.rb", "bin/karma"]**

** gem.summary = "A gem to list out all the learn-verified students karma points"**
** gem.homepage = 'http://github.com/pajamaw'**
** gem.licenses = 'MIT'**

** gem.executables << 'karma'**




###### **end**


The layout will look something along the lines of this. This last line you see the "executables" is the line that allows you to run your gem from $PATH. In order to do that the only thing you need to ensure is that you have a shebang line in your bin folder where your application is run.

Moving on, the job of karma_count is to scrape the learn-verified students' profiles in order to store and then list their "karma" points. Karma points are points awarded for helping other students out with technical issues that they're facing.

I was talking with my friend about those that were ahead of us in the course and figured that those that were farther ahead of us helped others out less in order to get through the material faster. My friend thought the opposite, saying that they must get bored if they're getting through it so fast and so they probably help out because they simply like the challenge! With that in mind I sought out everyone's karma!

Using Nokogiri and open-uri I scraped a site which we previously were tasked with which had each students name and github url's. The github url's were necessary because the path of each url was the path for the next student site that had the karma data that I required.


###### def add_student_attributes(attributes_hash)
attributes_hash.each do |k,v|
self.send(("#{k}="), v)
end
end


After initializing all of the students with hashtributes I scraped and stored their profile information into the corresponding student instances using the above code with  #send.

With that data I then had the necessary tools to scrape their profiles for karma.


###### 




###### def self.scrape_profile_page(profile_url)
specific_student = {}
begin
doc = Nokogiri::HTML(open(profile_url))
rescue
specific_student[:github_url] = nil
else
doc.search(".social-icon-container a").each do |social|
if social.attribute("href").value.scan(/github.com/) == ["github.com"]
specific_student[:github_url] = social.attribute("href").value
else
specific_student[:github_url] = nil
end
end
end
specific_student
end




###### def self.scrape_learn_for_karma(github_url)
specific_karma = {}
if github_url != nil
gh_parse = URI::parse(github_url)
learn_url = "https://www.learn.co" + gh_parse.path + ".html"
begin
doc = Nokogiri::HTML(open(learn_url))
rescue
specific_karma[:karma] = nil
else
points = doc.css(".karma-points h3").text.to_i
specific_karma[:karma] = points
end
else
specific_karma[:karma] = nil
end
specific_karma
end


These methods I used to scrape the information consecutively. Breaking the methods down you can see how each works.



	
  1. I set each blank hash awaiting attributes

	
  2. I then use the begin and rescue methods while I open and parse the url's. The rescue method prevents the program from stopping if it encounters a bad gateway.

	
  3. I then use css selectors to grab the data that I need.

	
  4. Set the data to the hash, rinse and repeat!


The karma method works in a similar fashion while using the URI::parse(x) method. This method parses out a url into its components i.e. its domain, path, query, etc. This was simpler than regex and made sure that I got what I wanted.

After self.send ing the attributes to the instances I've got my final dataset.

I created a simple CLI that respawned a new screen with every command by using system 'clear' at the beginning of my header method like so:


###### def header
system 'clear'
puts "______WELCOME TO THE KARMA COUNT____"
end


With my simple CLI in place all I needed was to be able to access and manipulate the data. As it was the first version of my first gem, I just needed it to work.


###### def all_karma
header
competitors = Student.all.select do |student|
student.karma if !(student.karma.nil? )
end
competitors.sort_by!{|student| student.karma}
puts "_______________KARMA HIGH SCORE_____________"
competitors.reverse.each_with_index do |student, index|
puts ""
puts " #{index.to_i.next}. #{student.name.upcase} from #{student.location} with #{student.karma} POINTS!"
puts "------------------------------------------------"
end


So to iterate over the array of of instances I used #select to immediately only grab the students that had karma != nil. So any of those that encountered bad gateways were immediately taken out of the scoreboard.

I used #sort_by! to change the competitors array in place and finished by using #reverse to label the students from highest to lowest while using #each_with_index so that the program could count out each for itself.

After adding a few more features such as search functions and a top 10. After I was sure that it worked (despite the speed) I completed the gem with gem push. This pushed the current commits up to rubygems which then listed it as a finished gem product ready to download.

I'll be building more and updating this blog more often so feel free to follow as I continue to explore new topics and write about my adventures and struggles through SQL, sinatra, ORM, AR, rails, JS, JQUERY, and more!

                            Hello...it's me. My name's Peter Wickwire, but most people know me as PJ. I'm a Cornell University 2015 graduate that got a job out of school working at an online advertising company. Within a few months it became clear that it wasn't for me, I liked building and active problem solving. Oddly enough around the same time I saw an article in my RSS feed about the new Learn-Verified program at the Flatiron School. At $1000/month with a 6 month estimate it blew other coding bootcamps out the door in price, but what particularly caught my eye was the GUARANTEE.

"If you don't get a job within 6 months of completing the program, your money, all of it, will be refunded."

No program is going to throw around that sort of guarantee unless it means it's going to happen, otherwise its just bad publicity for them. Especially with how competitive these programs are, all vying against each other in an ever-growing sea of discontented college-grads in the modern day workforce -- even if it sounds too good to be true...a program couldn't afford giving such insurance if it weren't true.

So I thought, why not?

I looked back into programming. I dabbled in high school and in college completing all the intro to ____  courses in CodeAcademy, and really enjoyed playing with Hackthissite.org, yet I never took any courses, despite my interest in it. This was due to my focus on the paths of med school or law school during my college years, which ultimately, as can be assumed, did not come to fruition. (After switching majors multiple times and,completing the pre-med track I ultimately decided I didn't want to bear any more huge student loans and so graduated with a degree in Government and a minor in Business).

So I applied! Went through the application process which was focused on building out a project in procedural and object oriented Ruby programming and a couple of interviews. And soon after I left my job. BAM! I got in! Which has led me to where I know am as a current student of the Full Stack Web Development program called Learn-Verified, which is hosted by the Flatiron School in Manhattan. The online curriculum focused on Full-Stack Development which boasts a job guarantee.

Now the nice thing to know about the program is that the bar has already been set high with their 'Immersive' program students, who run the same curriculum yet are in the Flatiron classroom everyday in the Financial District of Manhattan. So far nearly 100% of all the students that got in have graduated with jobs that as of this last year (2015) have hit an average salary of nearly $80,000.

Now I'm not saying that I'm just in this for the money...but that surely doesn't hurt my motivation! Being in the first class of their online/commuter program, where people around the world can participate in the project-driven curriculum, I'm excited to write about my experiences so that others that are looking to learn how to code can take my advice, stop whatever they're doing, and follow their passion.

So this blog, will ultimately entertain my thoughts about the course, the aftermath, projects, and any/all questions and answers relating to programming that I may ponder throughout my new career. Wish me luck!

A point: As a starting point, I'm currently working on a macbook retina and have gone through the HTML/CSS sections in which our end project was creating a website project using the Bootstrap framework. I'll most likely be blogging at some point about HTML/CSS but will likely focus more on OO Ruby, SQL, ORMs and ActiveRecord, Rack, Sinatra, and Rails in the future.
