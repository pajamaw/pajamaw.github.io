# Site 

UNDER CONSTRUCTION

# Static & Styling

I'm using jekyll to host this static site. Static because of ease and resilence. 

# This exists because

I have many hobbies, and I tend to find new things that I want to become "acceptable" at every other day. This constant intrigue into different new things can make it difficult to iterate upon an individual skill long enough to master it. A decade ago I realized that the only way to conquer this thirst was to start listing them and keeping physical track of them, as well as my day...and week...and month...and year. 

I miss the [link needed]renaissance man. The encyclopedic human, that had a repository of knowledge that he used to do, assess, address, and/or create anything. 

I felt for a long time this meant one had to retain this knowledge without help. I've learned that not only is that belief incorrect in the days of old, but foolish today. One should use any and every tool at their disposal. And this will be a tool to offload some of my mental activity.
