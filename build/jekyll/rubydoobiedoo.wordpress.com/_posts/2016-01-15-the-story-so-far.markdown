Hello...it's me. My name's Peter Wickwire, but most people know me as PJ. I'm a Cornell University 2015 graduate that got a job out of school working at an online advertising company. Within a few months it became clear that it wasn't for me, I liked building and active problem solving. Oddly enough around the same time I saw an article in my RSS feed about the new Learn-Verified program at the Flatiron School. At $1000/month with a 6 month estimate it blew other coding bootcamps out the door in price, but what particularly caught my eye was the GUARANTEE.

"If you don't get a job within 6 months of completing the program, your money, all of it, will be refunded."

No program is going to throw around that sort of guarantee unless it means it's going to happen, otherwise its just bad publicity for them. Especially with how competitive these programs are, all vying against each other in an ever-growing sea of discontented college-grads in the modern day workforce -- even if it sounds too good to be true...a program couldn't afford giving such insurance if it weren't true.

So I thought, why not?

I looked back into programming. I dabbled in high school and in college completing all the intro to ____  courses in CodeAcademy, and really enjoyed playing with Hackthissite.org, yet I never took any courses, despite my interest in it. This was due to my focus on the paths of med school or law school during my college years, which ultimately, as can be assumed, did not come to fruition. (After switching majors multiple times and,completing the pre-med track I ultimately decided I didn't want to bear any more huge student loans and so graduated with a degree in Government and a minor in Business).

So I applied! Went through the application process which was focused on building out a project in procedural and object oriented Ruby programming and a couple of interviews. And soon after I left my job. BAM! I got in! Which has led me to where I know am as a current student of the Full Stack Web Development program called Learn-Verified, which is hosted by the Flatiron School in Manhattan. The online curriculum focused on Full-Stack Development which boasts a job guarantee.

Now the nice thing to know about the program is that the bar has already been set high with their 'Immersive' program students, who run the same curriculum yet are in the Flatiron classroom everyday in the Financial District of Manhattan. So far nearly 100% of all the students that got in have graduated with jobs that as of this last year (2015) have hit an average salary of nearly $80,000.

Now I'm not saying that I'm just in this for the money...but that surely doesn't hurt my motivation! Being in the first class of their online/commuter program, where people around the world can participate in the project-driven curriculum, I'm excited to write about my experiences so that others that are looking to learn how to code can take my advice, stop whatever they're doing, and follow their passion.

So this blog, will ultimately entertain my thoughts about the course, the aftermath, projects, and any/all questions and answers relating to programming that I may ponder throughout my new career. Wish me luck!

A point: As a starting point, I'm currently working on a macbook retina and have gone through the HTML/CSS sections in which our end project was creating a website project using the Bootstrap framework. I'll most likely be blogging at some point about HTML/CSS but will likely focus more on OO Ruby, SQL, ORMs and ActiveRecord, Rack, Sinatra, and Rails in the future.
