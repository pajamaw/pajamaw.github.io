# Me

I have many hobbies, and I tend to find new things that I want to become "acceptable" at every other day. A few of them I'd like to master. I'm a list person. Without them I don't know how I'd organize myself. I enjoy swimming and physical activity. Puzzles and making things. Juggling and uniclying. I try and cook. I like my friends and my family and my girlfriend. And I really like birds. and persons.
