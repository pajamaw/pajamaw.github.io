# Me

I have many hobbies, and I tend to find new things that I want to become "conversational" at every day. A few of them I'd like to master. These things go on my list. I'm a list person. Without strict self-organization I don't know where I'd be. I enjoy swimming and physical activity. Puzzles and making things. Juggling and uniclying. I try and cook. I like my friends and my family and my girlfriend. I really like birds. and persons.
