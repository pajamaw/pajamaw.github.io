# Me

I have many hobbies, and I tend to find new things that I want to become "acceptable" at every other day. A few of them I'd like to master. I'm a list person. Without them I don't know how I'd organize myself. 

## A list of things I'm currently exploring

Poker
Bad Financial Markets

## A list of things I feel like I've explored a fair amount

## A list of things I like spend my time on

## A list of things I no longer would like to spend my time on

## A list of things I try not to spend time on

## A list of things I can no longer spend time on
