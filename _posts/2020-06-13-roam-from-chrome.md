Today's world is run by for-profit companies. These companies, that have more power than any of your elected representatives, [can sell your identity](https://www.androidauthority.com/verizon-att-selling-information-807684/), [create laws that affect you even if you don't work for them](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobbying), and [can blatently commit human rights violations](https://www.thesun.co.uk/tech/7181214/apple-samsung-facebook-human-rights-violations-child-labour/) with little to no pushback. 

So many of these companies exist and continue to thrive by offering products or services with discounts or rebates or for "free", while secretly (or not so secretly) selling your own data and/or deferring the real costs through shareholder funding until there exists no alternative. Upon winning the market, companies then inflate costs without competition.

Without protections, companies not only do this in their original market, but [expand into other markets to monopolize as well](https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/amazon-doesnt-just-want-to-dominate-the-market-it-wants-to-become-the-market/).

It's astonishing that some nonprofit companies can coexist in such a hostile "free" market. 

Mozilla is one of those magical entities. And I'd like to support it as much as I can. 

One of the smallest steps that I take to do so is use firefox over chrome. 

Firefox is not only a star when it comes to privacy converns, but the browser is just as fast as chromes, hogs significantly less RAM when it comes to having tabs open (which come on who doesn't have a solid 20 open at any one time), it also provides a significantly better developer experience when debugging network requests and tracking javascript events. 

The only problem is ALL OF MY 33 EXTENSIONS ARE ON CHROME. 

Which means I'm going to have to move them all over.

And you know what? 

That was enough. That has stopped me several times in the past from converting over. This little inconvenience stopped my whole credo from actually being fulfilled. 

Pretty pathetic.

I want to be a little better.

Hopefully this prevents others from similar turmoils.
