One thing that I never really learned a lot about during my time rapidly learning ruby and javascript at the Flatiron School, was data structures and algorithms.

My assumption is that this is most likely a pretty pervasive issue among most programming bootcamps, and for a good reason. Data Structures are not 100% necessary to understand programming, you can very well create websites and pretty complex programs that take in wide varieties of data, without even thinking about a Trie. And bootcamps want you to be able to create, and understand what you need to know. So besides some brain teaser/interview questions they probably won't be brought up much.

Data structures really play more of a role when one thinks about the efficiency of their program, the Big O of their methods and functions.

It wasn't until I dove headfirst into these concepts that I truly began to understand them and see why programming bootcamps and computer science really were different. Finding out why HashMaps were still quicker than the Map object in es6 because Map objects and Set objects still actually count insertion order! That most objects in fact are based off arrays, but that arrays weren't always constantly growing bracket monsters. Learning how .sort() actually works, and ways sort arrays and linked lists more quickly.

This will be the first of many posts that I write in this series, that seeks to lift the curtain from this monster, in the eyes of a bootcamp graduate that seeks to understand data-structures, algorithms, and Big O notation better. We'll start this series with a quick look at Big O notation which may not make sense at first, but as we're going through will make progressively more sense.
